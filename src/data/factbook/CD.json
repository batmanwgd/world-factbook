{"id":"CD","iso_a3":"COD","fips":"CG","continent":"AF","name":"Democratic Republic of the Congo","introduction":"Established as an official Belgian colony in 1908, the then-Republic of the Congo gained its independence in 1960, but its early years were marred by political and social instability. Col. Joseph MOBUTU seized power and declared himself president in a November 1965 coup. He subsequently changed his name - to MOBUTU Sese Seko - as well as that of the country - to Zaire. MOBUTU retained his position for 32 years through several sham elections, as well as through brutal force. Ethnic strife and civil war, touched off by a massive inflow of refugees in 1994 from fighting in Rwanda and Burundi, led in May 1997 to the toppling of the MOBUTU regime by a rebellion backed by Rwanda and Uganda and fronted by Laurent KABILA. He renamed the country the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), but in August 1998 his regime was itself challenged by a second insurrection again backed by Rwanda and Uganda. Troops from Angola, Chad, Namibia, Sudan, and Zimbabwe intervened to support KABILA's regime. In January 2001, KABILA was assassinated and his son, Joseph KABILA, was named head of state. In October 2002, the new president was successful in negotiating the withdrawal of Rwandan forces occupying the eastern DRC; two months later, the Pretoria Accord was signed by all remaining warring parties to end the fighting and establish a government of national unity. A transitional government was set up in July 2003; it held a successful constitutional referendum in December 2005 and elections for the presidency, National Assembly, and provincial legislatures took place in 2006. ++ In 2009, following a resurgence of conflict in the eastern DRC, the government signed a peace agreement with the National Congress for the Defense of the People (CNDP), a primarily Tutsi rebel group. An attempt to integrate CNDP members into the Congolese military failed, prompting their defection in 2012 and the formation of the M23 armed group - named after the 23 March 2009 peace agreements. Renewed conflict led to large population displacements and significant human rights abuses before the M23 was pushed out of DRC to Uganda and Rwanda in late 2013 by a joint DRC and UN offensive. In addition, the DRC continues to experience violence committed by other armed groups including the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, the Allied Democratic Forces, and assorted Mai Mai militias. In the most recent national elections, held in November 2011, disputed results allowed Joseph KABILA to be reelected to the presidency; the next presidential election is scheduled for late 2016.","communications":{"country_id":"CD","fixed_phones_total":"17,029","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"less than 1 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"5.466 million","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"47 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"inadequate system of radiotelephone communication stations with high maintenance costs and low telephone density","phone_system_international":"country code - 235; satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean) (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"fixed-line connections for less than 1 per 100 persons coupled with mobile-cellular subscribership base of about 45 per 100 persons","broadcast_media":"1 state-owned TV station; state-owned radio network, Radiodiffusion Nationale Tchadienne (RNT), operates national and regional stations; about 10 private radio stations; some stations rebroadcast programs from international broadcasters (2007)","internet_country_code":"td","internet_total_users":"314,000","internet_population_percent":"2.7","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58"},"economy":{"country_id":"CD","overview":"Chad’s landlocked location results in high transportation costs for imported goods and dependence on neighboring countries. Oil and agriculture are mainstays of Chad’s economy. Oil provides about 60% of export revenues, while cotton, cattle, livestock, and gum arabic provide the bulk of Chad's non-oil export earnings. The services sector contributes about one-third of GDP and has attracted foreign investment mostly through telecommunications and banking. ++  ++ Nearly all of Chad’s fuel is provided by one domestic refinery, and unanticipated shutdowns occasionally result in shortages. The country regulates the price of domestic fuel, providing an incentive for black market sales. ++  ++ Chad’s fiscal position is encumbered by declining oil prices, though high oil prices and strong local harvests supported the economy in recent years. Chad relies on foreign assistance and foreign capital for much public and private sector investment. Chad's investment climate remains challenging due to limited infrastructure, a lack of trained workers, extensive government bureaucracy, and corruption. Chad obtained a three-year extended credit facility from the IMF in 2014 and was granted debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative in April 2015.","gdp_power_parity":"$30.59 billion (2016 est.) ++ $30.93 billion (2015 est.) ++ $30.39 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"-1.1% (2016 est.) ++ 1.8% (2015 est.) ++ 6.9% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$2,600 (2016 est.) ++ $2,700 (2015 est.) ++ $2,700 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"71.4%","gdp_consumption":"4.4%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"30.8%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"0.4%","gdp_exports":"25.3%","gdp_imports":"-32.3% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"53%","gdp_sector_industry":"12.8%","gdp_sector_services":"34.2% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"cotton, sorghum, millet, peanuts, sesame, corn, rice, potatoes, onions, cassava (manioc, tapioca), cattle, sheep, goats, camels","industries":"oil, cotton textiles, brewing, natron (sodium carbonate), soap, cigarettes, construction materials","industrial_growth_rate":"-5% (2016 est.)","labor_force":"5.457 million (2016 est.)","labor_force_notes":"","labor_force_services":"","labor_force_industry":"","labor_force_agriculture":"80%","labor_force_occupation_notes":"","unemployment_rate":"NA%","population_below_poverty":"46.7% (2011 est.)","household_income_lowest_10":"2.6%","household_income_highest_10":"30.8% (2003)","budget_revenues":"","taxes_revenues":"15.6% of GDP (2016 est.)","budget_net":"-5.1% of GDP (2016 est.)","public_debt":"35.4% of GDP (2016 est.) ++ 33.5% of GDP (2015 est.)","external_debt":"$1.875 billion (31 December 2016 est.) ++ $2.802 billion (31 December 2015 est.)","fiscal_year":"calendar year","inflation_rate":"3.8% (2016 est.) ++ 4.6% (2015 est.)","central_bank_discount_rate":"4.25% (31 December 2009) ++ 4.75% (31 December 2008)","commercial_bank_prime_lending_rate":"15.5% (31 December 2016 est.) ++ 15.5% (31 December 2015 est.)","stock_money_narrow":"$1.741 billion (31 December 2016 est.) ++ $1.604 billion (31 December 2015 est.)","stock_money_broad":"$1.976 billion (31 December 2014 est.) ++ $1.751 billion (31 December 2013 est.)","stock_domestic_credit":"$1.324 billion (31 December 2016 est.) ++ $1.034 billion (31 December 2015 est.)","exports":"$4.053 billion (2016 est.) ++ $3.965 billion (2015 est.)","exports_commodities":"oil, livestock, cotton, sesame, gum arabic, shea butter","exports_partners":"US 58.5%, India 13.3%, Japan 11.3%, China 4.1% (2015)","imports":"$3.075 billion (2016 est.) ++ $3.071 billion (2015 est.)","imports_commodities":"machinery and transportation equipment, industrial goods, foodstuffs, textiles","imports_partners":"France 16.5%, China 14.2%, Cameroon 11%, US 6.4%, India 6%, Belgium 5.7%, Italy 4.8% (2015)","exchange_rates":"Cooperation Financiere en Afrique Centrale francs (XAF) per US dollar - ++ 605.7 (2016 est.) ++ 591.45 (2015 est.) ++ 591.45 (2014 est.) ++ 494.42 (2013 est.) ++ 510.53 (2012 est.)","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58"},"energy":{"country_id":"CD","electricity_production":"200 million kWh (2014 est.)","electricity_consumption":"200 million kWh (2014 est.)","electricity_exports":"0 kWh (2013 est.)","electricity_imports":"0 kWh (2013 est.)","electricity_generating_capacity":"41,000 kW (2014 est.)","electricity_fossil_fuels":"100% of total installed capacity (2012 est.)","electricity_nuclear":"0% of total installed capacity (2012 est.)","electricity_hydroelectric":"0% of total installed capacity (2012 est.)","electricity_renewable":"0% of total installed capacity (2012 est.)","crude_oil_production":"120,000 bbl\/day (2015 est.)","crude_oil_exports":"105,000 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","crude_oil_imports":"0 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","crude_oil_reserves":"1.5 billion bbl (1 January 2016 es)","petrol_production":"0 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","petrol_consumption":"2,200 bbl\/day (2014 est.)","petrol_exports":"0 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","petrol_imports":"2,215 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","natural_gas_production":"0 cu m (2013 est.)","natural_gas_consumption":"0 cu m (2013 est.)","natural_gas_exports":"0 cu m (2013 est.)","natural_gas_imports":"0 cu m (2013 est.)","natural_gas_reserves":"0 cu m (1 January 2014 es)","co2_output":"300,000 Mt (2013 est.)","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58"},"geography":{"country_id":"CD","location_description":"Central Africa, south of Libya","latitude":"-4.0383330","longitude":"21.7586640","mapReferences":"Africa","area_sqkm_total":1,"area_sqkm_land":1,"area_sqkm_water":24,"area_km_coastline":0,"area_note":"slightly more than three times the size of California","climate":"tropical in south, desert in north","terrain":"broad, arid plains in center, desert in north, mountains in northwest, lowlands in south","hazards":"hot, dry, dusty harmattan winds occur in north;
