Stiff resistance to the Red Army after the Bolshevik Revolution was eventually suppressed and a socialist republic established in 1924. During the Soviet era, intensive production of \"white gold\" (cotton) and grain led to overuse of agrochemicals and the depletion of water supplies, which have left the land degraded and the Aral Sea and certain rivers half dry. Independent since 1991 upon the dissolution of the USSR, the country has gradually lessened its dependence on the cotton monoculture by diversifying agricultural production while developing its mineral and petroleum export capacity and increasing its manufacturing base. Uzbekistan’s first president, Islom KARIMOV, led Uzbekistan for 25 years until his death in August 2016. The political transition to his successor, then-Prime Minister Shavkat MIRZIYOYEV was peaceful, but sidelined the constitutional process where the chairman of the Senate would have served as the acting president. MIRZIYOYEV, who won the presidential election in December 2016, has sought to improve relations with Uzbekistan’s neighbors and proposed wide-ranging economic and judicial reforms.","communications":{"country_id":"UZ","fixed_phones_total":"2,507,711","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"9 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"21.783 million","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"75 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"digital exchanges in large cities and in rural areas","phone_system_international":"country code - 998; linked by fiber-optic cable or microwave radio relay with CIS member states and to other countries by leased connection via the Moscow international gateway switch; the country also has a link to the Trans-Asia-Europe (TAE) fiber-optic (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"the state-owned telecommunications company, Uzbektelecom, owner of the fixed-line telecommunications system, has used loans from the Japanese government and the China Development Bank to upgrade fixed-line services including conversion to digital exchange","broadcast_media":"government controls media; 14 state-owned broadcasters - 10 TV and 4 radio - provide service to virtually the entire country; about 20 privately owned TV stations, overseen by local officials, broadcast to local markets; privately owned TV stations are re","internet_country_code":"uz","internet_total_users":"12.498 million","internet_population_percent":"42.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:01","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:01"},"economy":{"country_id":"UZ","overview":"Uzbekistan is a landlocked country with more than 60% of the population living in densely populated rural communities. Since its independence in September 1991, the government maintained its Soviet-style command economy with subsidies and tight controls on production and prices. Despite ongoing efforts to diversify crops, Uzbekistani agriculture remains largely centered on cotton; Uzbekistan is the world's fifth largest cotton exporter and sixth largest producer. Uzbekistan's growth has been driven primarily by state-led investments, and export of natural gas, gold, and cotton provides a significant share of foreign exchange earnings. In 2015, Russia’s Gazprom announced it would reduce its natural gas imports from Uzbekistan but Tashkent continues to export natural gas to China and Chinese investments in the country have substantially increased. ++  ++ While aware of the need to improve the investment climate, the government continues to intervene in the business sector and has not addressed the impediments to foreign investment in the country. In the past, Uzbekistani authorities have accused US and other foreign companies operating in Uzbekistan of violating Uzbekistani laws and have frozen and seized their assets. At the same time, the Uzbekistani Government has actively courted several major US and international corporations, offering financing and tax advantages. ++  ++ In 2003, the government accepted Article VIII obligations under the IMF, providing for full currency convertibility. However, strict currency controls and tightening of borders have lessened the effects of convertibility and have also led to some shortages that have further stifled economic activity. Recently, lower global commodity prices and economic slowdown in neighboring Russia and China have been hurting Uzbekistan's trade and investment and worsening its problem of currency shortage.","gdp_power_parity":"$202.3 billion (2016 est.) ++ $190.8 billion (2015 est.) ++ $176.7 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"6% (2016 est.) ++ 8% (2015 est.) ++ 8.1% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$6,500 (2016 est.) ++ $6,200 (2015 est.) ++ $5,800 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"55.3%","gdp_consumption":"17.2%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"24.4%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"3%","gdp_exports":"28.6%","gdp_imports":"-28.5% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"19.3%","gdp_sector_industry":"33.9%","gdp_sector_services":"46.8% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"cotton, vegetables, fruits, grain;
