Moreover, Dominica has an offshore medical education sector. In order to diversify the island's economy, the government is also attempting to foster an offshore financial industry and plans to sign agreements with the private sector to develop geothermal energy resources. In 2003, the government began a comprehensive restructuring of the economy - including the elimination of price controls, privatization of the state banana company, and tax increases - to address an economic and financial crisis and to meet IMF requirements. In 2009 and 2013, the economy contracted as a result of the global recession; growth remains anemic. Although public debt levels continue to exceed pre-recession levels, the debt burden declined from 78% of GDP in 2011 to approximately 70% in 2012.","gdp_power_parity":"$812 million (2016 est.) ++ $799.6 million (2015 est.) ++ $814 million (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"1.5% (2016 est.) ++ -1.8% (2015 est.) ++ 4.2% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$11,400 (2016 est.) ++ $11,300 (2015 est.) ++ $11,500 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"70.5%","gdp_consumption":"18.8%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"10.8%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"0%","gdp_exports":"28.6%","gdp_imports":"-28.7% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"14.7%","gdp_sector_industry":"15.5%","gdp_sector_services":"69.8% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"bananas, citrus, mangos, root crops, coconuts, cocoa","industries":"soap, coconut oil, tourism, copra, furniture, cement blocks, shoes","industrial_growth_rate":"1.6% (2016 est.)","labor_force":"25,000 (2000 est.)","labor_force_notes":"","labor_force_services":"28% (2002 est.)","labor_force_industry":"32%","labor_force_agriculture":"40%","labor_force_occupation_notes":"","unemployment_rate":"23% (2000 est.)","population_below_poverty":"29% (2009 est.)","household_income_lowest_10":"NA%","household_income_highest_10":"NA%","budget_revenues":"","taxes_revenues":"28.3% of GDP (2016 est.)","budget_net":"0% of GDP (2016 est.)","public_debt":"70% of GDP (2012 est.) ++ 78% of GDP (2009 est.)","external_debt":"$288.6 million (31 December 2016 est.) ++ $275.4 million (31 December 2015 est.)","fiscal_year":"1 July - 30 June","inflation_rate":"1.4% (2016 est.) ++ -0.8% (2015 est.)","central_bank_discount_rate":"6.5% (31 December 2010) ++ 6.5% (31 December 2009)","commercial_bank_prime_lending_rate":"8.6% (31 December 2016 est.) ++ 8.7% (31 December 2015 est.)","stock_money_narrow":"$114.6 million (31 December 2016 est.) ++ $96.59 million (31 December 2015 est.)","stock_money_broad":"$504.8 million (31 December 2016 est.) ++ $480.7 million (31 December 2015 est.)","stock_domestic_credit":"$296.3 million (31 December 2016 est.) ++ $259.3 million (31 December 2015 est.)","exports":"$38.3 million (2016 est.) ++ $35.2 million (2015 est.)","exports_commodities":"bananas, soap, bay oil, vegetables, grapefruit, oranges","exports_partners":"Japan 38.1%, Jamaica 19%, Antigua and Barbuda 10.4%, Trinidad and Tobago 6.2%, St. Lucia 4.8%, St. Kitts and Nevis 4.2% (2015)","imports":"$186.5 million (2016 est.) ++ $182.9 million (2015 est.)","imports_commodities":"manufactured goods, machinery and equipment, food, chemicals","imports_partners":"Japan 42%, Trinidad and Tobago 17%, US 11.9%, China 6% (2015)","exchange_rates":"East Caribbean dollars (XCD) per US dollar - ++ 2.7 (2016 est.) ++ 2.7 (2015 est.) ++ 2.7 (2014 est.) ++ 2.7 (2013 est.) ++ 2.7 (2012 est.)","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58"},"energy":{"country_id":"DO","electricity_production":"97 million kWh (2014 est.)","electricity_consumption":"90.21 million kWh (2014 est.)","electricity_exports":"0 kWh (2013 est.)","electricity_imports":"0 kWh (2013 est.)","electricity_generating_capacity":"33,200 kW (2014 est.)","electricity_fossil_fuels":"60.2% of total installed capacity (2012 est.)","electricity_nuclear":"0% of total installed capacity (2012 est.)","electricity_hydroelectric":"18.1% of total installed capacity (2012 est.)","electricity_renewable":"21.7% of total installed capacity (2012 est.)","crude_oil_production":"0 bbl\/day (2015 est.)","crude_oil_exports":"0 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","crude_oil_imports":"0 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","crude_oil_reserves":"0 bbl (1 January 2016 es)","petrol_production":"0 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","petrol_consumption":"1,000 bbl\/day (2014 est.)","petrol_exports":"0 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","petrol_imports":"978.2 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","natural_gas_production":"0 cu m (2013 est.)","natural_gas_consumption":"0 cu m (2013 est.)","natural_gas_exports":"0 cu m (2013 est.)","natural_gas_imports":"0 cu m (2013 est.)","natural_gas_reserves":"0 cu m (1 January 2014 es)","co2_output":"100,000 Mt (2013 est.)","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58"},"geography":{"country_id":"DO","location_description":"Caribbean, island between the Caribbean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean, about halfway between Puerto Rico and Trinidad and Tobago","latitude":"18.7356930","longitude":"-70.1626510","mapReferences":"Central America and the Caribbean","area_sqkm_total":751,"area_sqkm_land":751,"area_sqkm_water":0,"area_km_coastline":148,"area_note":"slightly more than four times the size of Washington, DC","climate":"tropical;
