{"id":"NI","iso_a3":"NIC","fips":"NU","continent":"NA","name":"Nicaragua","introduction":"The Pacific coast of Nicaragua was settled as a Spanish colony from Panama in the early 16th century. Independence from Spain was declared in 1821 and the country became an independent republic in 1838. Britain occupied the Caribbean Coast in the first half of the 19th century, but gradually ceded control of the region in subsequent decades. Violent opposition to governmental manipulation and corruption spread to all classes by 1978 and resulted in a short-lived civil war that brought the Marxist Sandinista guerrillas to power in 1979. Nicaraguan aid to leftist rebels in El Salvador prompted the US to sponsor anti-Sandinista contra guerrillas through much of the 1980s. After losing free and fair elections in 1990, 1996, and 2001, former Sandinista President Daniel ORTEGA Saavedra was elected president in 2006 and reelected in 2011. The 2008 municipal elections, 2010 regional elections, 2011 presidential election, 2012 municipal elections, and 2013 regional elections were marred by widespread irregularities. Nicaragua's infrastructure and economy - hard hit by the earlier civil war and by Hurricane Mitch in 1998 - are slowly being rebuilt, but democratic institutions have been weakened under the ORTEGA administration.","communications":{"country_id":"NI","fixed_phones_total":"187,155","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"less than 1 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"150.83 million","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"83 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"further expansion and modernization of the fixed-line telephone network is needed; network quality remains a problem","phone_system_international":"country code - 234; landing point for the SAT-3\/WASC fiber-optic submarine cable that provides connectivity to Europe and Asia; satellite earth stations - 3 Intelsat (2 Atlantic Ocean and 1 Indian Ocean) (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"fixed-line subscribership remains only about 1 per 100 persons; mobile-cellular services growing rapidly, in part responding to the shortcomings of the fixed-line network; multiple cellular providers operate nationally with subscribership base over 80 per","broadcast_media":"nearly 70 federal government-controlled national and regional TV stations; all 36 states operate TV stations; several private TV stations operational; cable and satellite TV subscription services are available; network of federal government-controlled nat (2007)","internet_country_code":"ng","internet_total_users":"86.138 million","internet_population_percent":"47.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:00","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:00"},"economy":{"country_id":"NI","overview":"Following an April 2014 statistical \"rebasing\" exercise, Nigeria has emerged as Africa's largest economy, with 2015 GDP estimated at $1.1 trillion. Oil has been a dominant source of income and government revenues since the 1970s. Following the 2008-9 global financial crises, the banking sector was effectively recapitalized and regulation enhanced. Nigeriaâ€™s economic growth over the last five years has been driven by growth in agriculture, telecommunications, and services. Economic diversification and strong growth have not translated into a significant decline in poverty levels, however - over 62% of Nigeria's 170 million people still live in extreme poverty. ++  ++ Despite its strong fundamentals, oil-rich Nigeria has been hobbled by inadequate power supply, lack of infrastructure, delays in the passage of legislative reforms, an inefficient property registration system, restrictive trade policies, an inconsistent regulatory environment, a slow and ineffective judicial system, unreliable dispute resolution mechanisms, insecurity, and pervasive corruption. Regulatory constraints and security risks have limited new investment in oil and natural gas, and Nigeria's oil production has contracted every year since 2012. ++  ++ Because of lower oil prices, GDP growth in 2015 fell to around 3%, and government revenues declined, while the nonoil sector also contracted due to economic policy uncertainty. President BUHARI, elected in March 2015, has established a cabinet of economic ministers that includes several technocrats, and he has announced plans to increase transparency, diversify the economy away from oil, and improve fiscal management. The government is working to develop stronger public-private partnerships for roads, agriculture, and power. The medium-term outlook for Nigeria is positive, assuming oil output stabilizes and oil prices recover.","gdp_power_parity":"$1.089 trillion (2016 est.) ++ $1.108 trillion (2015 est.) ++ $1.08 trillion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"-1.7% (2016 est.) ++ 2.7% (2015 est.) ++ 6.3% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$5,900 (2016 est.) ++ $6,200 (2015 est.) ++ $6,200 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"79%","gdp_consumption":"7.2%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"14.2%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"0.7%","gdp_exports":"9%","gdp_imports":"-10.1% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"21.1%","gdp_sector_industry":"19.4%","gdp_sector_services":"59.5% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"cocoa, peanuts, cotton, palm oil, corn, rice, sorghum, millet, cassava (manioc, tapioca), yams, rubber;
