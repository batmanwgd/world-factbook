{"id":"MR","iso_a3":"MRT","fips":"MR","continent":"AF","name":"Mauritania","introduction":"Independent from France in 1960, Mauritania annexed the southern third of the former Spanish Sahara (now Western Sahara) in 1976 but relinquished it after three years of raids by the Polisario guerrilla front seeking independence for the territory. Maaouya Ould Sid Ahmed TAYA seized power in a coup in 1984 and ruled Mauritania with a heavy hand for more than two decades. A series of presidential elections that he held were widely seen as flawed. A bloodless coup in August 2005 deposed President TAYA and ushered in a military council that oversaw a transition to democratic rule. Independent candidate Sidi Ould Cheikh ABDALLAHI was inaugurated in April 2007 as Mauritania's first freely and fairly elected president. His term ended prematurely in August 2008 when a military junta led by General Mohamed Ould Abdel AZIZ deposed him and installed a military council government. AZIZ was subsequently elected president in July 2009 and sworn in the following month. AZIZ sustained injuries from an accidental shooting by his own troops in October 2012 but has continued to maintain his authority. He was reelected in 2014 to a second and final term as president (according to the present constitution). The country continues to experience ethnic tensions among three major groups: Arabic-speaking descendants of slaves (Haratines), Arabic-speaking \"White Moors\" (Bidhan), and members of Sub-Saharan ethnic groups mostly originating in the Senegal River valley (Halpulaar, Soninke, and Wolof). Mauritania confronts a terrorism threat by al-Qa'ida in the Islamic Maghreb, which launched successful attacks between 2005 and 2010.","communications":{"country_id":"MR","fixed_phones_total":"51,294","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"1 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"3.644 million","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"101 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"limited system of cable and open-wire lines, minor microwave radio relay links, and radiotelephone communications stations; mobile-cellular services expanding rapidly","phone_system_international":"country code - 222; satellite earth stations - 3 (1 Intelsat - Atlantic Ocean, 2 Arabsat); fiber-optic and asymmetric digital subscriber line cables for Internet access (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"fixed-line teledensity 1 per 100 persons; mobile-cellular network coverage extends mainly to urban areas with a teledensity of roughly 100 per 100 persons; mostly cable and open-wire lines; a domestic satellite telecommunications system links Nouakchott w","broadcast_media":"one state-run TV (Television de Mauritanie) and one state-run radio network (Radio de Mauritanie); Television de Mauritanie has three channels, Al Mahadra station (for Islamic content) and Channels 1 and 2, which cover news, sports, and other programming; (2013)","internet_country_code":"mr","internet_total_users":"547,000","internet_population_percent":"15.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:00","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:00"},"economy":{"country_id":"MR","overview":"Mauritania's economy is dominated by natural resources and agriculture. Half the population still depends on agriculture and livestock for a livelihood, even though many nomads and subsistence farmers were forced into the cities by recurrent droughts in the 1970s and 1980s. Recently, GDP growth has been driven by foreign investment in the mining and oil sectors. ++  ++ Mauritania's extensive mineral resources include iron ore, gold, copper, gypsum, and phosphate rock, and exploration is ongoing for uranium, crude oil, and natural gas. Extractive commodities make up about three-quarters of Mauritania's total exports, subjecting the economy to price swings in world commodity markets. Mining is also a growing source of government revenue, rising from 13% to 29% of total revenue between 2006 and 2013. The nation's coastal waters are among the richest fishing areas in the world, and fishing accounts for about 25% of budget revenues, but overexploitation by foreigners threatens this key source of revenue. ++  ++ Risks to Mauritania's economy include its recurring droughts, dependence on foreign aid and investment, and insecurity in neighboring Mali, as well as significant shortages of infrastructure, institutional capacity, and human capital. Mauritania has sought additional IMF support by focusing efforts on poverty reduction. Investment in agriculture and infrastructure are the largest components of the countryâ€™s public expenditures.","gdp_power_parity":"$16.71 billion (2016 est.) ++ $16.19 billion (2015 est.) ++ $15.99 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"3.2% (2016 est.) ++ 1.2% (2015 est.) ++ 5.4% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$4,400 (2016 est.) ++ $4,400 (2015 est.) ++ $4,400 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"72.5%","gdp_consumption":"23.8%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"47%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"-7.2%","gdp_exports":"25.7%","gdp_imports":"-61.8% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"24.1%","gdp_sector_industry":"34.8%","gdp_sector_services":"41.1% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"dates, millet, sorghum, rice, corn;
