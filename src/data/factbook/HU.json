The kingdom eventually became part of the polyglot Austro-Hungarian Empire, which collapsed during World War I. The country fell under communist rule following World War II. In 1956, a revolt and an announced withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact were met with a massive military intervention by Moscow. Under the leadership of Janos KADAR in 1968, Hungary began liberalizing its economy, introducing so-called \"Goulash Communism.\" Hungary held its first multiparty elections in 1990 and initiated a free market economy. It joined NATO in 1999 and the EU five years later.","communications":{"country_id":"HU","fixed_phones_total":"3,094,228","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"31 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"11.786 million","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"119 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"modern telephone system is digital and highly automated; trunk services are carried by fiber-optic cable and digital microwave radio relay","phone_system_international":"country code - 36; Hungary has fiber-optic cable connections with all neighboring countries; the international switch is in Budapest; satellite earth stations - 2 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean and Indian Ocean regions), 1 Inmarsat, 1 very small aperture termin (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"competition among mobile-cellular service providers has led to a sharp increase in the use of mobile-cellular phones since 2000 and a decrease in the number of fixed-line connections","broadcast_media":"mixed system of state-supported public service broadcast media and private broadcasters; the 5 publicly owned TV channels and the 2 main privately owned TV stations are the major national broadcasters; a large number of special interest channels; highly d (2016)","internet_country_code":"hu","internet_total_users":"7.209 million","internet_population_percent":"72.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:59","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:59"},"economy":{"country_id":"HU","overview":"Hungary has made the transition from a centrally planned to a market economy, with a per capita income nearly two-thirds that of the EU-28 average. ++  ++ In late 2008, Hungary's impending inability to service its short-term debt - brought on by the global financial crisis - led Budapest to obtain an IMF\/EU\/World Bank-arranged financial assistance package worth over $25 billion. The global economic downturn, declining exports, and low domestic consumption and investment, dampened by government austerity measures, resulted in a severe economic contraction in 2009. In 2010, the new government implemented a number of changes including cutting business and personal income taxes, but imposed \"crisis taxes\" on financial institutions, energy and telecom companies, and retailers. The IMF\/EU bailout program lapsed at the end of 2010 and was replaced by Post Program Monitoring and Article IV Consultations on overall economic and fiscal processes. At the end of 2011 the government turned to the IMF and the EU to obtain a financial backstop to support its efforts to refinance foreign currency debt and bond obligations in 2012 and beyond, but Budapest's rejection of EU and IMF economic policy recommendations led to a breakdown in talks with the lenders in late 2012. Global demand for high yield has since helped Hungary to obtain funds on international markets. ++  ++ Hungaryâ€™s progress reducing its deficit to under 3% of GDP led the European Commission in 2013 to permit Hungary for the first time since joining the EU in 2004 to exit the Excessive Deficit Procedure. The government remains committed to keeping the budget deficit in check and lowering public debt by using sectoral taxes, while relying on state interventionist measures to lower utility prices and boost growth and employment.","gdp_power_parity":"$267.6 billion (2016 est.) ++ $262.4 billion (2015 est.) ++ $254.9 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"2% (2016 est.) ++ 2.9% (2015 est.) ++ 3.7% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$27,200 (2016 est.) ++ $26,600 (2015 est.) ++ $25,800 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"50.3%","gdp_consumption":"20%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"20.4%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"0.6%","gdp_exports":"94.3%","gdp_imports":"-85.6% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"3.5%","gdp_sector_industry":"31.8%","gdp_sector_services":"64.7% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"wheat, corn, sunflower seed, potatoes, sugar beets;
