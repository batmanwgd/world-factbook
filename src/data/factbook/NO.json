In 1397, Norway was absorbed into a union with Denmark that lasted more than four centuries. In 1814, Norwegians resisted the cession of their country to Sweden and adopted a new constitution. Sweden then invaded Norway but agreed to let Norway keep its constitution in return for accepting the union under a Swedish king. Rising nationalism throughout the 19th century led to a 1905 referendum granting Norway independence. Although Norway remained neutral in World War I, it suffered heavy losses to its shipping. Norway proclaimed its neutrality at the outset of World War II, but was nonetheless occupied for five years by Nazi Germany (1940-45). In 1949, Norway abandoned neutrality and became a member of NATO. Discovery of oil and gas in adjacent waters in the late 1960s boosted Norway's economic fortunes. In referenda held in 1972 and 1994, Norway rejected joining the EU. Key domestic issues include immigration and integration of ethnic minorities, maintaining the country's extensive social safety net with an aging population, and preserving economic competitiveness.","communications":{"country_id":"NO","fixed_phones_total":"1,029,545","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"20 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"5.841 million","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"112 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"modern in all respects; one of the most advanced telecommunications networks in Europe","phone_system_international":"country code - 47; 2 buried coaxial cable systems; submarine cables provide links to other Nordic countries and Europe; satellite earth stations - NA Eutelsat, NA Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean), and 1 Inmarsat (Atlantic and Indian Ocean regions); note - Norway (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"Norway has a domestic satellite system; the prevalence of rural areas encourages the wide use of mobile-cellular systems","broadcast_media":"state-owned public radio-TV broadcaster operates 3 nationwide TV stations, 3 nationwide radio stations, and 16 regional radio stations; roughly a dozen privately owned television stations broadcast nationally and roughly another 25 local TV stations broad (2008)","internet_country_code":"no","internet_total_users":"5.042 million","internet_population_percent":"96.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:00","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:00"},"economy":{"country_id":"NO","overview":"Norway's has a stable economy with a vibrant private sector, a large state sector, and an extensive social safety net. Norway opted out of the EU during a referendum in November 1994; nonetheless, as a member of the European Economic Area, it contributes sizably to the EU budget. ++  ++ The country is richly endowed with natural resources in addition to oil and gas, including hydropower, fish, forests, and minerals. The government manages the country’s petroleum resources through extensive regulation. The petroleum sector provides about 9% of jobs, 15% of GDP, and 39% of exports, according to official national estimates. Norway is one of the world's leading petroleum exporters, though oil production in 2015 was close to 50% below its peak in 2000; annual gas production, conversely, more than doubled over the same time period. ++  ++ In anticipation of eventual declines in oil and gas production, Norway saves state revenue from petroleum sector activities in the world's largest sovereign wealth fund, valued at over $800 billion as of early 2016. The government allows itself to use up to 4% of the fund’s value, its annual expected real rate of return, to help balance the federal budget each year. After solid GDP growth in 2004-07, the economy slowed in 2008, and contracted in 2009, before returning to modest, positive growth from 2010 to 2015. Lower oil prices in 2015 caused growth to slow, increased unemployment, and weakened the Norwegian krone. The latter trend has mitigated the negative impact of lower oil and gas prices by making Norwegian exports cheaper for foreign buyers. The government has expressed willingness to increase public spending from the sovereign wealth fund to help prevent a recession.","gdp_power_parity":"$364.7 billion (2016 est.) ++ $361.7 billion (2015 est.) ++ $356 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"0.8% (2016 est.) ++ 1.6% (2015 est.) ++ 2.2% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$69,300 (2016 est.) ++ $69,500 (2015 est.) ++ $69,100 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"44%","gdp_consumption":"24.3%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"23.3%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"5.4%","gdp_exports":"36.1%","gdp_imports":"-33.1% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"1.8%","gdp_sector_industry":"34.7%","gdp_sector_services":"63.5% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"barley, wheat, potatoes;
