{"id":"IT","iso_a3":"ITA","fips":"IT","continent":"EU","name":"Italy","introduction":"Italy became a nation-state in 1861 when the regional states of the peninsula, along with Sardinia and Sicily, were united under King Victor EMMANUEL II. An era of parliamentary government came to a close in the early 1920s when Benito MUSSOLINI established a Fascist dictatorship. His alliance with Nazi Germany led to Italy's defeat in World War II. A democratic republic replaced the monarchy in 1946 and economic revival followed. Italy is a charter member of NATO and the European Economic Community (EEC). It has been at the forefront of European economic and political unification, joining the Economic and Monetary Union in 1999. Persistent problems include sluggish economic growth, high youth and female unemployment, organized crime, corruption, and economic disparities between southern Italy and the more prosperous north.","communications":{"country_id":"IT","fixed_phones_total":"20,236,305","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"33 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"92.52 million","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"150 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"modern, well-developed, fast; fully automated telephone, telex, and data services","phone_system_international":"country code - 39; a series of submarine cables provide links to Asia, Middle East, Europe, North Africa, and US; satellite earth stations - 3 Intelsat (with a total of 5 antennas - 3 for Atlantic Ocean and 2 for Indian Ocean), 1 Inmarsat (Atlantic Ocean (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"high-capacity cable and microwave radio relay trunks","broadcast_media":"two Italian media giants dominate - the publicly owned Radiotelevisione Italiana (RAI) with 3 national terrestrial stations and privately owned Mediaset with 3 national terrestrial stations; a large number of private stations and Sky Italia - a satellite (2007)","internet_country_code":"it","internet_total_users":"40.559 million","internet_population_percent":"65.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:59","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:59"},"economy":{"country_id":"IT","overview":"Italy has a diversified economy, which is divided into a developed industrial north, dominated by private companies, and a less-developed, highly subsidized, agricultural south, where unemployment is higher. The Italian economy is driven in large part by the manufacture of high-quality consumer goods produced by small and medium-sized enterprises, many of them family-owned. Italy also has a sizable underground economy, which by some estimates accounts for as much as 17% of GDP. These activities are most common within the agriculture, construction, and service sectors. ++  ++ Italy is the third-largest economy in the euro zone, but its exceptionally high public debt and structural impediments to growth have rendered it vulnerable to scrutiny by financial markets. Public debt has increased steadily since 2007, topping 135% of GDP in 2015, but investor concerns about Italy and the broader euro-zone crisis eased in 2013, bringing down Italy's borrowing costs on sovereign government debt from euro-era records. The government still faces pressure from investors and European partners to sustain its efforts to address Italy's longstanding structural impediments to growth, such as labor market inefficiencies and tax evasion. In 2014, economic growth and labor market conditions continued to deteriorate, with overall unemployment rising to 12.7% and youth unemployment around 40%, but Italy began to recover in 2015, with marginal growth and a slight reduction in unemployment.","gdp_power_parity":"$2.221 trillion (2016 est.) ++ $2.204 trillion (2015 est.) ++ $2.187 trillion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"0.8% (2016 est.) ++ 0.8% (2015 est.) ++ -0.3% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$36,300 (2016 est.) ++ $36,300 (2015 est.) ++ $36,000 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"60.9%","gdp_consumption":"18.8%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"16.5%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"0.2%","gdp_exports":"29.7%","gdp_imports":"-26.1% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"2.2%","gdp_sector_industry":"23.9%","gdp_sector_services":"73.8% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"fruits, vegetables, grapes, potatoes, sugar beets, soybeans, grain, olives;
