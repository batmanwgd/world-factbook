In 1840, their chieftains entered into a compact with Britain, the Treaty of Waitangi, in which they ceded sovereignty to Queen Victoria while retaining territorial rights. That same year, the British began the first organized colonial settlement. A series of land wars between 1843 and 1872 ended with the defeat of the native peoples. The British colony of New Zealand became an independent dominion in 1907 and supported the UK militarily in both world wars. New Zealand's full participation in a number of defense alliances lapsed by the 1980s. In recent years, the government has sought to address longstanding Maori grievances. New Zealand assumed a nonpermanent seat on the UN Security Council for the 2015-16 term.","communications":{"country_id":"NZ","fixed_phones_total":"1.85 million","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"42 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"5.6 million","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"126 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"excellent domestic and international systems","phone_system_international":"country code - 64; the Southern Cross submarine cable system provides links to Australia, Fiji, and the US; satellite earth stations - 8 (1 Inmarsat - Pacific Ocean, 7 other) (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"combined fixed-line and mobile-cellular telephone subscribership exceeds 160 per 100 persons","broadcast_media":"state-owned Television New Zealand operates multiple TV networks and state-owned Radio New Zealand operates 3 radio networks and an external shortwave radio service to the South Pacific region; a small number of national commercial TV and radio stations a (2008)","internet_country_code":"nz","internet_total_users":"3.916 million","internet_population_percent":"88.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:00","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:00"},"economy":{"country_id":"NZ","overview":"Over the past 30 years, the government has transformed New Zealand from an agrarian economy, dependent on concessionary British market access, to a more industrialized, free market economy that can compete globally. This dynamic growth has boosted real incomes - but left behind some at the bottom of the ladder - and broadened and deepened the technological capabilities of the industrial sector. ++  ++ Per capita income rose for ten consecutive years until 2007 in purchasing power parity terms, but fell in 2008-09. Debt-driven consumer spending drove robust growth in the first half of the decade, fueling a large balance of payments deficit that posed a challenge for policymakers. Inflationary pressures caused the central bank to raise its key rate steadily from January 2004 until it was among the highest in the OECD in 2007-08. The higher rate attracted international capital inflows, which strengthened the currency and housing market while aggravating the current account deficit. ++  ++ The economy fell into recession before the start of the global financial crisis and contracted for five consecutive quarters in 2008-09. In line with global peers, the central bank cut interest rates aggressively and the government developed fiscal stimulus measures. The economy pulled out of recession in 2009, and achieved 2%-3% growth from 2011 to 2015. Nevertheless, key trade sectors remain vulnerable to weak external demand and lower commodity prices. In the aftermath of the 2010 Canterbury earthquakes, the government has continued programs to expand export markets, develop capital markets, invest in innovation, raise productivity growth, and develop infrastructure, while easing its fiscal austerity.","gdp_power_parity":"$174.8 billion (2016 est.) ++ $170.1 billion (2015 est.) ++ $165.2 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"2.8% (2016 est.) ++ 3% (2015 est.) ++ 3% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$37,100 (2016 est.) ++ $36,600 (2015 est.) ++ $36,300 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"57.4%","gdp_consumption":"18.5%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"23.5%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"0.3%","gdp_exports":"26.7%","gdp_imports":"-26.4% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"4.2%","gdp_sector_industry":"26.5%","gdp_sector_services":"69.2% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"dairy products, sheep, beef, poultry, fruit, vegetables, wine, seafood, wheat and barley","industries":"agriculture, forestry, fishing, logs and wood articles, manufacturing, mining, construction, financial services, real estate services, tourism","industrial_growth_rate":"2.6% (2016 est.)","labor_force":"2.562 million (2016 est.)","labor_force_notes":"","labor_force_services":"74% (2006 est.)","labor_force_industry":"19%","labor_force_agriculture":"7%","labor_force_occupation_notes":"","unemployment_rate":"5.1% (2016 est.) ++ 5.4% (2015 est.)","population_below_poverty":"NA%","household_income_lowest_10":"NA%","household_income_highest_10":"NA%","budget_revenues":"","taxes_revenues":"37.7% of GDP (2016 est.)","budget_net":"0.3% of GDP (2016 est.)","public_debt":"34% of GDP (2016 est.) ++ 35% of GDP (2015 est.)","external_debt":"$81.39 billion (31 December 2016 est.) ++ $83.4 billion (31 December 2015 est.)","fiscal_year":"1 April - 31 March","inflation_rate":"0.6% (2016 est.) ++ 0.3% (2015 est.)","central_bank_discount_rate":"2.5% (31 December 2009) ++ 5% (31 December 2008)","commercial_bank_prime_lending_rate":"5% (31 December 2016 est.) ++ 5.76% (31 December 2015 est.)","stock_money_narrow":"$34.99 billion (31 December 2016 est.) ++ $31.58 billion (31 December 2015 est.)","stock_money_broad":"$115 billion (31 December 2016 est.) ++ $102.8 billion (31 December 2015 est.)","stock_domestic_credit":"$373.8 billion (31 December 2016 est.) ++ $342.4 billion (31 December 2015 est.)","exports":"$31.96 billion (2016 est.) ++ $34.41 billion (2015 est.)","exports_commodities":"dairy products, meat and edible offal, logs and wood articles, fruit, crude oil, wine","exports_partners":"China 17.5%, Australia 16.9%, US 11.8%, Japan 6% (2015)","imports":"$34.83 billion (2016 est.) ++ $35.8 billion (2015 est.)","imports_commodities":"petroleum and products, mechanical machinery, vehicles and parts, electrical machinery, textiles","imports_partners":"China 19.4%, Australia 11.8%, US 11.7%, Japan 6.6%, Germany 4.7%, Thailand 4.2% (2015)","exchange_rates":"New Zealand dollars (NZD) per US dollar - ++ 1.441 (2016 est.) ++ 1.4279 (2015 est.) ++ 1.4279 (2014 est.) ++ 1.2039 (2013 est.) ++ 1.23 (2012 est.)","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:00","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:00"},"energy":{"country_id":"NZ","electricity_production":"43 billion kWh (2014 est.)","electricity_consumption":"40 billion kWh (2014 est.)","electricity_exports":"0 kWh (2013 est.)","electricity_imports":"0 kWh (2013 est.)","electricity_generating_capacity":"9.7 million kW (2014 est.)","electricity_fossil_fuels":"29% of total installed capacity (2012 est.)","electricity_nuclear":"0% of total installed capacity (2012 est.)","electricity_hydroelectric":"55.2% of total installed capacity (2012 est.)","electricity_renewable":"15.8% of total installed capacity (2012 est.)","crude_oil_production":"41,280 bbl\/day (2015 est.)","crude_oil_exports":"34,090 bbl\/day (2015 est.)","crude_oil_imports":"104,700 bbl\/day (2015 est.)","crude_oil_reserves":"67.2 million bbl (1 January 2016 es)","petrol_production":"119,300 bbl\/day (2015 est.)","petrol_consumption":"160,700 bbl\/day (2015 est.)","petrol_exports":"5,345 bbl\/day (2015 est.)","petrol_imports":"46,360 bbl\/day (2015 est.)","natural_gas_production":"5.241 billion cu m (2014 est.)","natural_gas_consumption":"5.387 billion cu m (2014 est.)","natural_gas_exports":"0 cu m (2014 est.)","natural_gas_imports":"0 cu m (2014 est.)","natural_gas_reserves":"36.9 billion cu m (1 January 2016 es)","co2_output":"37 million Mt (2013 est.)","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:00","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:00"},"geography":{"country_id":"NZ","location_description":"Oceania, islands in the South Pacific Ocean, southeast of Australia","latitude":"-40.9005570","longitude":"174.8859710","mapReferences":"Oceania","area_sqkm_total":268,"area_sqkm_land":264,"area_sqkm_water":4,"area_km_coastline":15,"area_note":"almost twice the size of North Carolina;
