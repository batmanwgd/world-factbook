Tourism together with tourism-driven construction and manufacturing accounts for approximately 60% of GDP and directly or indirectly employs half of the archipelago's labor force. Financial services constitute the second-most important sector of the Bahamian economy and, when combined with business services, account for about 35% of GDP. Manufacturing and agriculture combined contribute less than one 10th of GDP and show little growth, despite government incentives aimed at those sectors. The economy of The Bahamas shrank at an average pace of 0.8% annually between 2007 and 2011, and tourism, financial services, and construction - pillars of the national economy - remain subdued. Conditions are improving in the tourism sector, however, due to steady foreign investment led activity. New resort and marina developments are likely to provide sustained employment opportunities.","gdp_power_parity":"$9.066 billion (2016 est.) ++ $9.042 billion (2015 est.) ++ $9.195 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"0.3% (2016 est.) ++ -1.7% (2015 est.) ++ -0.5% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$24,600 (2016 est.) ++ $24,800 (2015 est.) ++ $25,500 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"65.7%","gdp_consumption":"16.3%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"27.3%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"1%","gdp_exports":"36.9%","gdp_imports":"-47.2% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"2.3%","gdp_sector_industry":"7.6%","gdp_sector_services":"90.1% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"citrus, vegetables;
