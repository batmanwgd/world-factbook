{"id":"NE","iso_a3":"NER","fips":"NG","continent":"AF","name":"Niger","introduction":"Niger became independent from France in 1960 and experienced single-party and military rule until 1991, when Gen. Ali SAIBOU was forced by public pressure to allow multiparty elections, which resulted in a democratic government in 1993. Political infighting brought the government to a standstill and in 1996 led to a coup by Col. Ibrahim BARE. In 1999, BARE was killed in a counter coup by military officers who restored democratic rule and held elections that brought Mamadou TANDJA to power in December of that year. TANDJA was reelected in 2004 and in 2009 spearheaded a constitutional amendment allowing him to extend his term as president. In February 2010, military officers led a coup that deposed TANDJA and suspended the constitution. ISSOUFOU Mahamadou was elected in April 2011 following the coup and reelected to a second term in early 2016. Niger is one of the poorest countries in the world with minimal government services and insufficient funds to develop its resource base. The largely agrarian and subsistence-based economy is frequently disrupted by extended droughts common to the Sahel region of Africa. A Tuareg rebellion emerged in 2007 and ended in 2009. Niger is facing increased security concerns on its borders from various external threats including insecurity in Libya, spillover from the conflict in Mali, and violent extremism in northeastern Nigeria.","communications":{"country_id":"NE","fixed_phones_total":"","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"","mobile_phones_total":"","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"","phone_system_general_assessment":"","phone_system_international":"country code - 683 (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"single-line (fixed line) telephone system connects all villages (and virtually all households) on island","broadcast_media":"1 government-owned TV station with many of the programs supplied by Television New Zealand; 1 government-owned radio station broadcasting in AM and FM (2009)","internet_country_code":"nu","internet_total_users":"1,090","internet_population_percent":"91.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:00","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:00"},"economy":{"country_id":"NE","overview":"The economy suffers from the typical Pacific island problems of geographic isolation, few resources, and a small population. The agricultural sector consists mainly of subsistence gardening, although some cash crops are grown for export. Industry consists primarily of small factories for processing passion fruit, lime oil, honey, and coconut cream. The sale of postage stamps to foreign collectors is an important source of revenue. ++  ++ Government expenditures regularly exceed revenues, and the shortfall is made up by critically needed grants from New Zealand that are used to pay wages to public employees. Economic aid allocation from New Zealand in FY13\/14 was US$10.1 million. Niue has cut government expenditures by reducing the public service by almost half. ++  ++ The island in recent years has suffered a serious loss of population because of emigration to New Zealand. Efforts to increase GDP include the promotion of tourism and financial services, although the International Banking Repeal Act of 2002 resulted in the termination of all offshore banking licenses.","gdp_power_parity":"$10.01 million (2003 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"6.2% (2003 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$5,800 (2003 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"","gdp_consumption":"","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"","gdp_exports":"","gdp_imports":"","gdp_sector_agriculture":"23.5%","gdp_sector_industry":"26.9%","gdp_sector_services":"49.5% (2003)","agriculture_products":"coconuts, passion fruit, honey, limes, taro, yams, cassava (manioc, tapioca), sweet potatoes;
