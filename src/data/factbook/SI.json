In 1918, the Slovenes joined the Serbs and Croats in forming a new multinational state, which was named Yugoslavia in 1929. After World War II, Slovenia became a republic of the renewed Yugoslavia, which though communist, distanced itself from Moscow's rule. Dissatisfied with the exercise of power by the majority Serbs, the Slovenes succeeded in establishing their independence in 1991 after a short 10-day war. Historical ties to Western Europe, a strong economy, and a stable democracy have assisted in Slovenia's transformation to a modern state. Slovenia acceded to both NATO and the EU in the spring of 2004; it joined the euro zone and the Schengen zone in 2007.","communications":{"country_id":"SI","fixed_phones_total":"753,082","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"38 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"2.354 million","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"119 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"well-developed telecommunications infrastructure","phone_system_international":"country code - 386 (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"combined fixed-line and mobile-cellular teledensity roughly 155 telephones per 100 persons","broadcast_media":"public TV broadcaster, Radiotelevizija Slovenija (RTV), operates a system of national and regional TV stations; 35 domestic commercial TV stations operating nationally, regionally, and locally; about 60% of households are connected to multi-channel cable (2007)","internet_country_code":"si","internet_total_users":"1.45 million","internet_population_percent":"73.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:01","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:01"},"economy":{"country_id":"SI","overview":"With excellent infrastructure, a well-educated work force, and a strategic location between the Balkans and Western Europe, Slovenia has one of the highest per capita GDPs in Central Europe, despite having suffered a protracted recession in 2008-2009 in the wake of the global financial crisis. Slovenia became the first 2004 EU entrant to adopt the euro (on 1 January 2007) and has experienced one of the most stable political transitions in Central and Southeastern Europe. ++  ++ In March 2004, Slovenia became the first transition country to graduate from borrower status to donor partner at the World Bank. In 2007, Slovenia was invited to begin the process for joining the OECD; it became a member in 2012. However, long-delayed privatizations, particularly within Slovenia’s largely state-owned and increasingly indebted banking sector, have fueled investor concerns since 2012 that the country would need EU-IMF financial assistance. In 2013, the European Commission granted Slovenia permission to begin recapitalizing ailing lenders and transferring their nonperforming assets into a “bad bank” established to restore bank balance sheets. Export-led growth fueled by demand in larger European markets pushed GDP growth to 3.0% in 2014, while stubbornly-high unemployment fell slightly to 12%. ++  ++ Prime Minister CERAR’s government took office in September 2014, pledging to press ahead with commitments to privatize a select group of state-run companies, rationalize public spending, and further stabilize the banking sector.","gdp_power_parity":"$66.13 billion (2016 est.) ++ $64.62 billion (2015 est.) ++ $63.15 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"2.3% (2016 est.) ++ 2.3% (2015 est.) ++ 3.1% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$32,000 (2016 est.) ++ $31,300 (2015 est.) ++ $30,600 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"51.7%","gdp_consumption":"18.6%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"19%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"0.8%","gdp_exports":"79.7%","gdp_imports":"-69.8% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"2.3%","gdp_sector_industry":"33.6%","gdp_sector_services":"64.1% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"hops, wheat, coffee, corn, apples, pears;
