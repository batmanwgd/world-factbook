Some basic foodstuffs must still be imported. Cocoa, coffee, and cotton generate about 40% of export earnings with cotton being the most important cash crop. Togo is among the world's largest producers of phosphate and seeks to develop its carbonate phosphate reserves. ++  ++ The government's decade-long effort, supported by the World Bank and the IMF, to implement economic reform measures, encourage foreign investment, and bring revenues in line with expenditures has moved slowly. Togo completed its IMF Extended Credit Facility in 2011 and reached a Heavily Indebted Poor Country debt relief completion point in 2010 at which 95% of the country's debt was forgiven. Togo continues to work with the IMF on structural reforms. Progress depends on follow through on privatization, increased openness in government financial operations, progress toward legislative elections, and continued support from foreign donors. ++  ++ Togoâ€™s 2015 economic growth remained steady at 5.4%, largely driven by infusions of foreign aid, infrastructure investment in the port and mineral sectors, and improvements in the business climate. Foreign direct investment inflows have slowed in recent years.","gdp_power_parity":"$11.61 billion (2016 est.) ++ $11.02 billion (2015 est.) ++ $10.46 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"5.3% (2016 est.) ++ 5.4% (2015 est.) ++ 5.4% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$1,500 (2016 est.) ++ $1,500 (2015 est.) ++ $1,500 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"107%","gdp_consumption":"16.2%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"21%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"0%","gdp_exports":"49.3%","gdp_imports":"-93.5% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"27.5%","gdp_sector_industry":"21.3%","gdp_sector_services":"51.2% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"coffee, cocoa, cotton, yams, cassava (manioc, tapioca), corn, beans, rice, millet, sorghum;
