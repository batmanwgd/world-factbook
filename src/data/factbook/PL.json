{"id":"PL","iso_a3":"POL","fips":"PL","continent":"EU","name":"Poland","introduction":"Poland's history as a state began near the middle of the 10th century. By the mid-16th century, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ruled a vast tract of land in Central and Eastern Europe. During the 18th century, internal disorders weakened the nation, and in a series of agreements between 1772 and 1795, Russia, Prussia, and Austria partitioned Poland among themselves. Poland regained its independence in 1918 only to be overrun by Germany and the Soviet Union in World War II. It became a Soviet satellite state following the war, but its government was comparatively tolerant and progressive. Labor turmoil in 1980 led to the formation of the independent trade union \"Solidarity\" that over time became a political force with over 10 million members. Free elections in 1989 and 1990 won Solidarity control of the parliament and the presidency, bringing the communist era to a close. A \"shock therapy\" program during the early 1990s enabled the country to transform its economy into one of the most robust in Central Europe. Poland joined NATO in 1999 and the EU in 2004. With its transformation to a democratic, market-oriented country largely completed and with large investments in defense, energy, and other infrastructure, Poland is an increasingly active member of Euro-Atlantic organizations.","communications":{"country_id":"PL","fixed_phones_total":"4.245 million","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"11 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"56.838 million","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"147 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"modernization of the telecommunications network has accelerated with market-based competition; fixed-line service, dominated by the former state-owned company, is dwarfed by the growth in mobile-cellular services","phone_system_international":"country code - 48; international direct dialing with automated exchanges; satellite earth station - 1 with access to Intelsat, Eutelsat, Inmarsat, and Intersputnik (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"several nation-wide networks provide mobile-cellular service; coverage is generally good; fixed-line service lags in rural areas","broadcast_media":"state-run public TV operates 2 national channels supplemented by 16 regional channels and several niche channels; privately owned entities operate several national TV networks and a number of special interest channels; many privately owned channels broadc (2007)","internet_country_code":"pl","internet_total_users":"26.221 million","internet_population_percent":"68.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:00","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:00"},"economy":{"country_id":"PL","overview":"Poland has pursued a policy of economic liberalization since 1990 and Poland's economy was the only EU country to avoid a recession through the 2008-09 economic downturn. Although EU membership and access to EU structural funds have provided a major boost to the economy since 2004, GDP per capita remains significantly below the EU average and the unemployment rate is now below the EU average. ++  ++ The government of Prime Minister Donald TUSK steered the Polish economy through the economic downturn by skillfully managing public finances and adopting controversial pension and tax reforms to further shore up public finances. While the Polish economy has performed well over the past five years, growth slowed in 2013 and picked back up in 2014-15. Poland’s new center-right Law and Justice government plans to introduce expansionary economic policies to spur long-term growth, but social spending programs are expected to lead to increased deficit spending over the medium term. ++  ++ Poland faces several challenges, which include addressing some of the remaining deficiencies in its road and rail infrastructure, business environment, rigid labor code, commercial court system, government red tape, and burdensome tax system, especially for entrepreneurs. Additional long-term challenges include diversifying Poland’s energy mix and sources of supply, strengthening investments in innovation, research, and development, and as well as stemming the outflow of educated young Poles to other EU member states, especially in light of a coming demographic contraction due to emigration, persistently low fertility rates, and the aging of the Solidarity-era baby boom generation.","gdp_power_parity":"$1.052 trillion (2016 est.) ++ $1.02 trillion (2015 est.) ++ $984.4 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"3.1% (2016 est.) ++ 3.7% (2015 est.) ++ 3.3% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$27,700 (2016 est.) ++ $26,800 (2015 est.) ++ $25,900 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"57.4%","gdp_consumption":"17.8%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"19.8%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"0.8%","gdp_exports":"50.5%","gdp_imports":"-46.3% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"2.7%","gdp_sector_industry":"38.5%","gdp_sector_services":"58.9% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"potatoes, fruits, vegetables, wheat;
