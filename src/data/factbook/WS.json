It has a nominal GDP of $780 million. Agriculture, including fishing, employs roughly two-thirds of the labor force and furnishes 90% of exports, featuring fish, coconut oil, nonu products, and taro. The manufacturing sector mainly processes agricultural products. One factory in the Foreign Trade Zone employs 1,000 people to make automobile electrical harnesses for an assembly plant in Australia, and accounts for 65% of total exports. Industry accounts for nearly 15% of GDP while employing less than 6% of the work force. The service sector accounts for nearly three-quarters of GDP and employs approximately 50% of the labor force. Tourism is an expanding sector accounting for 25% of GDP; 132,000 tourists visited the islands in 2013. ++  ++ The country is vulnerable to devastating storms. In September 2009, an earthquake and the resulting tsunami severely damaged Samoa and nearby American Samoa, disrupting transportation and power generation, and resulting in about 200 deaths. In December 2012, extensive flooding and wind damage from Tropical Cyclone Evan killed four people, displaced over 6,000, and damaged or destroyed an estimated 1,500 homes on Samoa's Upolu Island. ++  ++ The Samoan Government has called for deregulation of the country's financial sector, encouragement of investment, and continued fiscal discipline, while at the same time protecting the environment. Foreign reserves are relatively healthy and inflation is low, but external debt is approximately 55% of GDP. Samoa became the 155th member of the WTO in May 2012, and graduated from least developed country (LDC) status in January 2014.","gdp_power_parity":"$1.046 billion (2016 est.) ++ $1.015 billion (2015 est.) ++ $999.1 million (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"3% (2016 est.) ++ 1.6% (2015 est.) ++ 1.2% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$5,400 (2016 est.) ++ $5,300 (2015 est.) ++ $5,200 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"","gdp_consumption":"","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"","gdp_exports":"","gdp_imports":"","gdp_sector_agriculture":"10.7%","gdp_sector_industry":"24%","gdp_sector_services":"65.4% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"coconuts, nonu, bananas, taro, yams, coffee, cocoa","industries":"food processing, building materials, auto parts","industrial_growth_rate":"6.4% (2016 est.)","labor_force":"49,180 (2013 est.)","labor_force_notes":"","labor_force_services":"NA%","labor_force_industry":"NA%","labor_force_agriculture":"65%","labor_force_occupation_notes":"","unemployment_rate":"NA%","population_below_poverty":"NA%","household_income_lowest_10":"NA%","household_income_highest_10":"NA%","budget_revenues":"","taxes_revenues":"26.6% of GDP (2016 est.)","budget_net":"-4.4% of GDP (2016 est.)","public_debt":"","external_debt":"$447.2 million (31 December 2013 est.) ++ $450.2 million (31 December 2014 est.)","fiscal_year":"June 1 - May 31","inflation_rate":"2% (2016 est.) ++ 0.7% (2015 est.)","central_bank_discount_rate":"","commercial_bank_prime_lending_rate":"9.4% (31 December 2016 est.) ++ 9.39% (31 December 2015 est.)","stock_money_narrow":"$129.6 million (31 December 2016 est.) ++ $116.5 million (31 December 2015 est.)","stock_money_broad":"$352 million (31 December 2016 est.) ++ $334.4 million (31 December 2015 est.)","stock_domestic_credit":"$382.4 million (31 December 2016 est.) ++ $360.8 million (31 December 2015 est.)","exports":"$24 million (2013 est.) ++ $27.5 million (2014 est.)","exports_commodities":"fish, coconut oil and cream, nonu, copra, taro, automotive parts, garments, beer","exports_partners":"American Samoa 57.1%, Australia 17.2% (2015)","imports":"$325.3 million (2013 est.) ++ $341.3 million (2014 est.)","imports_commodities":"machinery and equipment, industrial supplies, foodstuffs","imports_partners":"Fiji 22.6%, NZ 18.8%, China 15.8%, South Korea 7.9%, Australia 6%, US 5.6%, Singapore 5.2% (2015)","exchange_rates":"tala (SAT) per US dollar - ++ 2.575 (2016 est.) ++ 2.5609 (2015 est.) ++ 2.5609 (2014 est.) ++ 2.3318 (2013 est.) ++ 2.29 (2012 est.)","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:01","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:01"},"energy":{"country_id":"WS","electricity_production":"100 million kWh (2014 est.)","electricity_consumption":"100 million kWh (2014 est.)","electricity_exports":"0 kWh (2013 est.)","electricity_imports":"0 kWh (2013 est.)","electricity_generating_capacity":"45,000 kW (2014 est.)","electricity_fossil_fuels":"71.4% of total installed capacity (2012 est.)","electricity_nuclear":"0% of total installed capacity (2012 est.)","electricity_hydroelectric":"28.6% of total installed capacity (2012 est.)","electricity_renewable":"0% of total installed capacity (2012 est.)","crude_oil_production":"0 bbl\/day (2015 est.)","crude_oil_exports":"0 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","crude_oil_imports":"0 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","crude_oil_reserves":"0 bbl (1 January 2016 es)","petrol_production":"0 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","petrol_consumption":"1,700 bbl\/day (2014 est.)","petrol_exports":"0 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","petrol_imports":"1,688 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","natural_gas_production":"0 cu m (2013 est.)","natural_gas_consumption":"0 cu m (2013 est.)","natural_gas_exports":"0 cu m (2013 est.)","natural_gas_imports":"0 cu m (2013 est.)","natural_gas_reserves":"0 cu m (1 January 2014 es)","co2_output":"200,000 Mt (2013 est.)","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:01","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:01"},"geography":{"country_id":"WS","location_description":"Oceania, group of islands in the South Pacific Ocean, about halfway between Hawaii and New Zealand","latitude":"-13.7590290","longitude":"-172.1046290","mapReferences":"Oceania","area_sqkm_total":2,"area_sqkm_land":2,"area_sqkm_water":10,"area_km_coastline":403,"area_note":"slightly smaller than Rhode Island","climate":"tropical;
