Agriculture, employing more than one-quarter of the working population, provides the economic base with major exports of copra and citrus fruit. Black pearls are the Cook Islands' leading export. Manufacturing activities are limited to fruit processing, clothing, and handicrafts. Trade deficits are offset by remittances from emigrants and by foreign aid overwhelmingly from New Zealand. In the 1980s and 1990s, the country lived beyond its means, maintaining a bloated public service and accumulating a large foreign debt. Subsequent reforms, including the sale of state assets, the strengthening of economic management, the encouragement of tourism, and a debt restructuring agreement, have rekindled investment and growth.","gdp_power_parity":"$244.1 million (2010 est.) ++ $183.2 million (2005 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"0.1% (2005 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$12,300 (2010 est.) ++ $9,100 (2005 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"","gdp_consumption":"","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"","gdp_exports":"","gdp_imports":"","gdp_sector_agriculture":"5.1%","gdp_sector_industry":"12.7%","gdp_sector_services":"82.1% (2010 est.)","agriculture_products":"copra, citrus, pineapples, tomatoes, beans, pawpaws, bananas, yams, taro, coffee;
