Self-governing since 1620, Bermuda is the oldest and most populous of the British overseas territories. Vacationing to the island to escape North American winters first developed in Victorian times. Tourism continues to be important to the island's economy, although international business has overtaken it in recent years. Bermuda has also developed into a highly successful offshore financial center. A referendum on independence from the UK was soundly defeated in 1995.","communications":{"country_id":"BM","fixed_phones_total":"523,722","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"1 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"41.529 million","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"74 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"meets minimum requirements for local and intercity service for business and government","phone_system_international":"country code - 95; landing point for the SEA-ME-WE-3 optical telecommunications submarine cable that provides links to Asia, the Middle East, and Europe; satellite earth stations - 2, Intelsat (Indian Ocean) and ShinSat (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"the government eased its monopoly on communications in 2013 and granted telecom licenses to two foreign operators, which has resulted in a dramatic expansion of the wireless network","broadcast_media":"government controls all domestic broadcast media; 2 state-controlled TV stations with 1 of the stations controlled by the armed forces; 2 pay-TV stations are joint state-private ventures; access to satellite TV is limited; 1 state-controlled domestic radi","internet_country_code":"mm","internet_total_users":"12.278 million","internet_population_percent":"21.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:57","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:57"},"economy":{"country_id":"BM","overview":"Since the transition to a civilian government in 2011, Burma has begun an economic overhaul aimed at attracting foreign investment and reintegrating into the global economy. Economic reforms have included establishing a managed float of the Burmese kyat in 2012, re-writing the Foreign Investment Law in 2012 to allow more foreign investment participation, granting the Central Bank operational independence in July 2013, enacting a new Anti-corruption Law in September 2013, and granting licenses to nine foreign banks in 2014 and four more foreign banks in 2016. ++  ++ The government’s commitment to reform, and the subsequent easing of most Western sanctions, led to accelerated growth in 2013 and 2014. In 2015, growth slowed because of political uncertainty in an election year, summer floods, and external factors, including China’s slowdown and lower commodity prices. Burma’s abundant natural resources, young labor force, and proximity to Asia’s dynamic economies have attracted foreign investment in the energy sector, garment industry, information technology, and food and beverages. Pledged foreign direct investment grew from $4.1 billion in FY 2013 to $8.1 billion in FY 2014. ++  ++ Despite these improvements, living standards have not improved for the majority of the people residing in rural areas. Burma remains one of the poorest countries in Asia – approximately 26% of the country’s 51 million people live in poverty. The previous government’s isolationist policies and economic mismanagement have left Burma with poor infrastructure, endemic corruption, underdeveloped human resources, and inadequate access to capital, which will require a major commitment to reverse. The Burmese government has been slow to address impediments to economic development such as insecure land rights, a restrictive trade licensing system, an opaque revenue collection system, and an antiquated banking system. The newly elected government, led by AUNG SAN SUU KYI, will likely focus on accelerating agricultural productivity and land reforms, modernizing and opening the financial sector, and improving fiscal management.","gdp_power_parity":"$311.1 billion (2016 est.) ++ $287.8 billion (2015 est.) ++ $268.9 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"8.1% (2016 est.) ++ 7% (2015 est.) ++ 8.7% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$6,000 (2016 est.) ++ $5,600 (2015 est.) ++ $5,200 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"57.9%","gdp_consumption":"6.2%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"37.7%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"0.2%","gdp_exports":"24.4%","gdp_imports":"-26.4% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"26.3%","gdp_sector_industry":"27.5%","gdp_sector_services":"46.2% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"rice, pulses, beans, sesame, groundnuts;
