Economic development was spurred in the late 19th century with a railroad linkup to France and the opening of a casino. Since then, the principality's mild climate, splendid scenery, and gambling facilities have made Monaco world famous as a tourist and recreation center.","communications":{"country_id":"MC","fixed_phones_total":"","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"25 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"1.896 million","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"320 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"fairly modern communication facilities maintained for domestic and international services","phone_system_international":"country code - 853; landing point for the SEA-ME-WE-3 submarine cable network that provides links to Asia, the Middle East, and Europe; HF radiotelephone communication facility; satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat (Indian Ocean) (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"termination of monopoly over mobile-cellular telephone services in 2001 spurred sharp increase in subscriptions with mobile-cellular teledensity exceeding 300 per 100 persons; fixed-line subscribership appears to have peaked and is now in decline","broadcast_media":"local government dominates broadcast media; 2 television stations operated by the government with one broadcasting in Portuguese and the other in Cantonese and Mandarin; 1 cable TV and 4 satellite TV services available; 3 radio stations broadcasting, of w (2015)","internet_country_code":"mo","internet_total_users":"460,000","internet_population_percent":"77.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:59","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:59"},"economy":{"country_id":"MC","overview":"Since opening up its locally-controlled casino industry to foreign competition in 2001, Macau has attracted tens of billions of dollars in foreign investment, transforming the territory into one of the world's largest gaming centers. Macau's gaming and tourism businesses were fueled by China's decision to relax travel restrictions on Chinese citizens wishing to visit Macau. In 2015, Macau's gaming-related taxes accounted for more than 76% of total government revenue. ++  ++ Macau's economy slowed dramatically in 2009 as a result of the global economic slowdown, but strong growth resumed in 2010-13, largely on the back of tourism from mainland China and the gaming sectors. In 2015, this city of 646,800 hosted nearly 30.7 million visitors. Almost 67% came from mainland China. Macau's traditional manufacturing industry has slowed greatly since the termination of the Multi-Fiber Agreement in 2005. Services export — primarily gaming — increasingly has driven Macau’s economic performance. Mainland China’s ongoing anti-corruption campaign has brought Macau’s gambling boom to a halt, with spending in casinos contracting 34.3% in 2015. As a result, Macau's inflation-adjusted GDP contracted 20.3% from 2014, down from double-digit expansion rates in 2010-13. Non-inflation adjusted exports of goods and services dropped 1.8% from 2014, reflecting the slowdown in gaming exports. ++  ++ Macau continues to face the challenges of managing its growing casino industry, risks from money-laundering activities, and the need to diversify the economy away from heavy dependence on gaming revenues. Macau's currency, the pataca, is closely tied to the Hong Kong dollar, which is also freely accepted in the territory.","gdp_power_parity":"$63.22 billion (2016 est.) ++ $66.38 billion (2015 est.) ++ $83.33 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"-4.7% (2016 est.) ++ -20.3% (2015 est.) ++ -0.9% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$96,100 (2016 est.) ++ $102,600 (2015 est.) ++ $131,000 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"28.7%","gdp_consumption":"11%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"21%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"-0.1%","gdp_exports":"73.7%","gdp_imports":"-34.3% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"0%","gdp_sector_industry":"11.2%","gdp_sector_services":"88.8% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"only 2% of land area is cultivated, mainly by vegetable growers;
