The country's key export industries include phosphate mining, fertilizer production, agricultural products and commercial fishing and it is also working on oil exploration projects. Senegal relies heavily on donor assistance, remittances and foreign direct investment. For the first time in the past twelve years, Senegal reached a growth rate of 6.5% in 2015 due in part to a buoyant performance in agriculture because of higher rainfall and productivity in the sector. ++  ++ President Macky SALL, who was elected in March 2012 under a reformist policy agenda, inherited an economy with high energy costs, a challenging business environment, and a culture of overspending. President SALL unveiled an ambitious economic plan, the Emerging Senegal Plan (ESP), which aims to implement priority economic reforms and investment projects to increase economic growth while preserving macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability. Bureaucratic bottlenecks and a challenging business climate are among the perennial challenges that may slow the implementation of this plan. ++  ++ Senegal is receiving technical support from the IMF from 2015-2017 under a Policy Support Instrument (PSI) to assist with implementation of the ESP. The PSI implementation continues to be satisfactory as concluded by the IMF’s second review mission in March 2016. Investors have signaled confidence in the country through Senegal’s successful Eurobond issuances in recent years, including in 2014. ++  ++ The government will focus on 19 projects under the ESP for the 2016 budget to continue the structural transformation of the economy. These 19 projects include the Thies-Touba Highway, including the new airport- Mbour-Thies Highway. Senegal will increase the national family allowances program and the community development emergency program in 2016. Electricity supply is a chief constraint for Senegal’s development. Electricity prices in Senegal are among the highest in the world. Power Africa, a program led by USAID and OPIC, plans to increase the current 500 mW of generating capacity to over 1,000 mW in the next three to five years. Recent gas discoveries on the Senegal-Mauritanian border, as well as just south of Dakar, will help alleviate some of the energy shortages.","gdp_power_parity":"$39.72 billion (2016 est.) ++ $37.24 billion (2015 est.) ++ $34.98 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"6.6% (2016 est.) ++ 6.5% (2015 est.) ++ 4.3% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$2,600 (2016 est.) ++ $2,500 (2015 est.) ++ $2,400 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"74.5%","gdp_consumption":"15%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"28.3%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"-0.3%","gdp_exports":"26.5%","gdp_imports":"-44% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"15.6%","gdp_sector_industry":"24.1%","gdp_sector_services":"60.3% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"peanuts, millet, corn, sorghum, rice, cotton, tomatoes, green vegetables;
