{"id":"LA","iso_a3":"LAO","fips":"LA","continent":"AS","name":"Laos","introduction":"Modern-day Laos has its roots in the ancient Lao kingdom of Lan Xang, established in the 14th century under King FA NGUM. For 300 years Lan Xang had influence reaching into present-day Cambodia and Thailand, as well as over all of what is now Laos. After centuries of gradual decline, Laos came under the domination of Siam (Thailand) from the late 18th century until the late 19th century when it became part of French Indochina. The Franco-Siamese Treaty of 1907 defined the current Lao border with Thailand. In 1975, the communist Pathet Lao took control of the government ending a six-century-old monarchy and instituting a strict socialist regime closely aligned to Vietnam. A gradual, limited return to private enterprise and the liberalization of foreign investment laws began in 1988. Laos became a member of ASEAN in 1997 and the WTO in 2013.","communications":{"country_id":"LA","fixed_phones_total":"962,497","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"14 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"3.727 million","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"54 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"service to public is generally improving; the government relies on a radiotelephone network to communicate with remote areas","phone_system_international":"country code - 856; satellite earth station - 1 Intersputnik (Indian Ocean region) and a second to be developed by China (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"mobile cellular usage has slowed as the regulator imposed a strict policy on pricing and competition is effectively discouraged; network performance has suffered because of insufficient maintenance and upgrades","broadcast_media":"6 TV stations operating out of Vientiane - 3 government-operated and the others commercial; 17 provincial stations operating with nearly all programming relayed via satellite from the government-operated stations in Vientiane; Chinese and Vietnamese progr (2012)","internet_country_code":"la","internet_total_users":"1.258 million","internet_population_percent":"18.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:59","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:59"},"economy":{"country_id":"LA","overview":"The government of Laos, one of the few remaining one-party communist states, began decentralizing control and encouraging private enterprise in 1986. Economic growth averaged 6% per year from 1988-2008 except during the short-lived drop caused by the Asian financial crisis that began in 1997. Laos' growth has more recently been amongst the fastest in Asia and averaged nearly 8% per year for the last decade. ++  ++ Nevertheless, Laos remains a country with an underdeveloped infrastructure, particularly in rural areas. It has a basic, but improving, road system, and limited external and internal land-line telecommunications. Electricity is available to 83% of the population. Agriculture, dominated by rice cultivation in lowland areas, accounts for about 25% of GDP and 73% of total employment. ++  ++ Laos' economy is heavily dependent on capital-intensive natural resource exports. The economy has benefited from high-profile foreign direct investment in hydropower dams along the Mekong River, copper and gold mining, logging, and construction, although some projects in these industries have drawn criticism for their environmental impacts. ++  ++ Laos gained Normal Trade Relations status with the US in 2004 and applied for Generalized System of Preferences trade benefits in 2013 after being admitted to the World Trade Organization earlier in the year. Laos began a one-year chairmanship of ASEAN in January 2016. Laos is in the process of implementing a value-added tax system. The government appears committed to raising the country's profile among foreign investors and has developed special economic zones replete with generous tax incentives, but a small labor pool remains an impediment to investment. Laos also has ongoing problems with the business environment, including onerous registration requirements, a gap between legislation and implementation, and unclear or conflicting regulations.","gdp_power_parity":"$40.96 billion (2016 est.) ++ $38.11 billion (2015 est.) ++ $35.43 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"7.5% (2016 est.) ++ 7.6% (2015 est.) ++ 7.5% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$5,700 (2016 est.) ++ $5,400 (2015 est.) ++ $5,100 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"62.6%","gdp_consumption":"14.1%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"33.1%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"1%","gdp_exports":"47.2%","gdp_imports":"-58% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"21.3%","gdp_sector_industry":"32.5%","gdp_sector_services":"39.4% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"sweet potatoes, vegetables, corn, coffee, sugarcane, tobacco, cotton, tea, peanuts, rice;
