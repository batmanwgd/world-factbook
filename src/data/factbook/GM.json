Like its Western European neighbors, Germany faces significant demographic challenges to sustained long-term growth. Low fertility rates and a large increase in net immigration are increasing pressure on the country's social welfare system and necessitate structural reforms. ++  ++ Reforms launched by the government of Chancellor Gerhard SCHROEDER (1998-2005), deemed necessary to address chronically high unemployment and low average growth, contributed to strong growth and falling unemployment. These advances, as well as a government subsidized, reduced working hour scheme, help explain the relatively modest increase in unemployment during the 2008-09 recession - the deepest since World War II. The new German Government introduced a minimum wage of about $11.60 (8.50 euros) per hour that took effect in 2015. ++  ++ Stimulus and stabilization efforts initiated in 2008 and 2009 and tax cuts introduced in Chancellor Angela MERKEL's second term increased Germany's total budget deficit - including federal, state, and municipal - to 4.1% in 2010, but slower spending and higher tax revenues reduced the deficit to 0.8% in 2011 and in 2015 Germany reached a budget surplus of 0.9%. A constitutional amendment approved in 2009 limits the federal government to structural deficits of no more than 0.35% of GDP per annum as of 2016, though the target was already reached in 2012. ++  ++ The German economy suffers from low levels of investment, and a government plan to invest 15 billion euros during 2016-18, largely in infrastructure, is intended to spur needed private investment. Following the March 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, Chancellor Angela MERKEL announced in May 2011 that eight of the country's 17 nuclear reactors would be shut down immediately and the remaining plants would close by 2022. Germany plans to replace nuclear power largely with renewable energy, which accounted for 27.8% of gross electricity consumption in 2014, up from 9% in 2000. Before the shutdown of the eight reactors, Germany relied on nuclear power for 23% of its electricity generating capacity and 46% of its base-load electricity production. Domestic consumption, bolstered by low energy prices and a weak euro, are likely to drive German GDP growth again in 2016.","gdp_power_parity":"$3.979 trillion (2016 est.) ++ $3.911 trillion (2015 est.) ++ $3.854 trillion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"1.7% (2016 est.) ++ 1.5% (2015 est.) ++ 1.6% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$48,200 (2016 est.) ++ $47,600 (2015 est.) ++ $47,500 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"53.7%","gdp_consumption":"19.5%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"20.1%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"-1%","gdp_exports":"45.7%","gdp_imports":"-38% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"0.6%","gdp_sector_industry":"30.3%","gdp_sector_services":"69.1% ++  (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"potatoes, wheat, barley, sugar beets, fruit, cabbages;
