Economically and technologically, the nation has developed in parallel with the US, its neighbor to the south across the world's longest international border. Canada faces the political challenges of meeting public demands for quality improvements in health care, education, social services, and economic competitiveness, as well as responding to the particular concerns of predominantly francophone Quebec. Canada also aims to develop its diverse energy resources while maintaining its commitment to the environment.","communications":{"country_id":"CA","fixed_phones_total":"15.902 million","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"45 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"29.39 million","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"84 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"excellent service provided by modern technology","phone_system_international":"country code - 1; submarine cables provide links to the US and Europe; satellite earth stations - 7 (5 Intelsat - 4 Atlantic Ocean and 1 Pacific Ocean, and 2 Intersputnik - Atlantic Ocean region) (2011)","phone_system_domestic":"domestic satellite system with about 300 earth stations","broadcast_media":"2 public TV broadcasting networks each with a large number of network affiliates; several private-commercial networks also with multiple network affiliates; overall, about 150 TV stations; multi-channel satellite and cable systems provide access to a wide (2008)","internet_country_code":"ca","internet_total_users":"31.053 million","internet_population_percent":"88.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58"},"economy":{"country_id":"CA","overview":"As a high-tech industrial society in the trillion-dollar class, Canada resembles the US in its market-oriented economic system, pattern of production, and high living standards. Since World War II, the impressive growth of the manufacturing, mining, and service sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural economy into one primarily industrial and urban. In addition, the country's petroleum sector is rapidly expanding, because Alberta's oil sands significantly boosted Canada's proven oil reserves. Canada now ranks third in the world in proved oil reserves behind Venezuela and Saudi Arabia and is the worldâ€™s fifth-largest oil producer. ++  ++ The 1989 US-Canada Free Trade Agreement and the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (which includes Mexico) touched off a dramatic increase in trade and economic integration with the US, its principal trading partner. Canada enjoys a substantial trade surplus with the US, which absorbs about three-fourths of Canadian merchandise exports each year. Canada is the US's largest foreign supplier of energy, including oil, gas, and electric power, and a top source of US uranium imports. ++  ++ Given its abundant natural resources, highly skilled labor force, and modern capital plant, Canada enjoyed solid economic growth from 1993 through 2007. Buffeted by the global economic crisis, the economy dropped into a sharp recession in the final months of 2008, and Ottawa posted its first fiscal deficit in 2009 after 12 years of surplus. Canada's major banks, however, emerged from the financial crisis of 2008-09 among the strongest in the world, owing to the early intervention by the Bank of Canada and the financial sector's tradition of conservative lending practices and strong capitalization. Canada achieved marginal growth in 2010-15, despite the recent drop in oil prices.","gdp_power_parity":"$1.674 trillion (2016 est.) ++ $1.655 trillion (2015 est.) ++ $1.638 trillion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"1.2% (2016 est.) ++ 1.1% (2015 est.) ++ 2.5% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$46,200 (2016 est.) ++ $46,200 (2015 est.) ++ $46,100 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"57.9%","gdp_consumption":"21.3%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"22.2%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"0.3%","gdp_exports":"31.9%","gdp_imports":"-33.6% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"1.6%","gdp_sector_industry":"27.7%","gdp_sector_services":"70.7% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"wheat, barley, oilseed, tobacco, fruits, vegetables;
