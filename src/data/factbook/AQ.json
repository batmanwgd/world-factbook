Economic activity is strongly linked to the US with which American Samoa conducts most of its commerce. Tuna fishing and tuna processing plants are the backbone of the private sector with canned tuna the primary export. The two tuna canneries accounted for 13.1% of employment in 2013. ++  ++ In late September 2009, an earthquake and the resulting tsunami devastated American Samoa and nearby Samoa, disrupting transportation and power generation, and resulting in about 200 deaths. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency oversaw a relief program of nearly $25 million. Transfers from the US Government add substantially to American Samoa's economic well-being. ++  ++ Attempts by the government to develop a larger and broader economy are restrained by Samoa's remote location, its limited transportation, and its devastating hurricanes. Tourism is a promising developing sector. In 2015, a new fish processing company completed refurbishing the processing facilities left behind by one of the two canneries that closed in 2009 and opened a new cannery. With two operating canneries once again, fish processing and exports will rise in the coming years.","gdp_power_parity":"$711 million (2013 est.) ++ $718 million (2012 est.) ++ $647 million (2012 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"-2.4% (2013 est.) ++ -2.7% (2012 est.) ++ 0.6% (2012 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$13,000 (2013 est.) ++ $13,100 (2012 est.) ++ $11,700 (2011 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"54.6%","gdp_consumption":"52.8%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"2.7%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"2.3%","gdp_exports":"54.4%","gdp_imports":"-66.8% (2013)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"27.4%","gdp_sector_industry":"12.4%","gdp_sector_services":"60.2% (2012)","agriculture_products":"bananas, coconuts, vegetables, taro, breadfruit, yams, copra, pineapples, papayas;
