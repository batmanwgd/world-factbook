Notably, Wallis and Futuna was the only French colony to side with the Vichy regime during World War II, a phase that ended in May of 1942 with the arrival of 2,000 American troops. In 1959, the inhabitants of the islands voted to become a French overseas territory and officially assumed this status in July 1961.","communications":{"country_id":"WF","fixed_phones_total":"3,132","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"20 (July 2014 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"","phone_system_general_assessment":"","phone_system_international":"country code - 681","phone_system_domestic":"","broadcast_media":"the publicly owned French Overseas Network (RFO), which broadcasts to France's overseas departments and territories, is carried on the RFO Wallis and Fortuna TV and radio stations (2008)","internet_country_code":"wf","internet_total_users":"3,450","internet_population_percent":"22.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:01","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:01"},"economy":{"country_id":"WF","overview":"The economy is limited to traditional subsistence agriculture, with 80% of labor force earnings coming from agriculture (coconuts and vegetables), livestock (mostly pigs), and fishing. However, roughly 70% of the labor force is employed in the public sector, although only about 20% of the population is in salaried employment. ++  ++ Revenues come from French Government subsidies, licensing of fishing rights to Japan and South Korea, import taxes, and remittances from expatriate workers in New Caledonia. France directly finances the public sector and healthcare and education services. It also provides funding for key development projects in a range of areas, including infrastructure, economic development, environmental management, and healthcare facilities. ++  ++ A key concern for Wallis and Futuna is an aging population with consequent economic development issues. Very few people aged 18-30 live on the islands due to the limited formal employment opportunities. Improving job creation is a current priority for the territorial government.","gdp_power_parity":"$60 million (2004 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"NA%","gdp_per_capita":"$3,800 (2004 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"","gdp_consumption":"","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"","gdp_exports":"","gdp_imports":"","gdp_sector_agriculture":"NA%","gdp_sector_industry":"NA%","gdp_sector_services":"NA%","agriculture_products":"coconuts, breadfruit, yams, taro, bananas;
