Claimed by Argentina but annexed by Brazil in 1821, Uruguay declared its independence four years later and secured its freedom in 1828 after a three-year struggle. The administrations of President Jose BATLLE in the early 20th century launched widespread political, social, and economic reforms that established a statist tradition. A violent Marxist urban guerrilla movement named the Tupamaros, launched in the late 1960s, led Uruguay's president to cede control of the government to the military in 1973. By yearend, the rebels had been crushed, but the military continued to expand its hold over the government. Civilian rule was not restored until 1985. In 2004, the left-of-center Frente Amplio Coalition won national elections that effectively ended 170 years of political control previously held by the Colorado and Blanco parties. Uruguay's political and labor conditions are among the freest on the continent.","communications":{"country_id":"UY","fixed_phones_total":"1,106,431","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"33 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"5.495 million","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"164 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"fully digitalized","phone_system_international":"country code - 598; the UNISOR submarine cable system provides direct connectivity to Brazil and Argentina; satellite earth stations - 2 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean) (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"most modern facilities concentrated in Montevideo; nationwide microwave radio relay network; overall fixed-line and mobile-cellular teledensity over 195 telephones per 100 persons","broadcast_media":"mixture of privately owned and state-run broadcast media; more than 100 commercial radio stations and about 20 TV channels; cable TV is available; many community radio and TV stations; adopted the hybrid Japanese\/Brazilian HDTV standard (ISDB-T) in Decemb (2010)","internet_country_code":"uy","internet_total_users":"2.159 million","internet_population_percent":"64.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:01","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:01"},"economy":{"country_id":"UY","overview":"Uruguay has a free market economy characterized by an export-oriented agricultural sector, a well-educated workforce, and high levels of social spending. Uruguay has sought to expand trade within the Common Market of the South (Mercosur) and with non-Mercosur members, and President VAZQUEZ has maintained his predecessorâ€™s mix of pro-market policies and a strong social safety net. ++  ++ Following financial difficulties in the late 1990s and early 2000s, Uruguay's economic growth averaged 8% annually during the period 2004-08. The 2008-09 global financial crisis put a brake on Uruguay's vigorous growth, which decelerated to 2.6% in 2009. Nevertheless, the country managed to avoid a recession and keep positive growth rates, mainly through higher public expenditure and investment; GDP growth reached 8.9% in 2010 but slowed in 2012-13 as a result of a renewed slowdown in the global economy and in Uruguay's main trade partners and Mercosur counterparts, Argentina and Brazil.","gdp_power_parity":"$73.93 billion (2016 est.) ++ $73.86 billion (2015 est.) ++ $73.14 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"0.1% (2016 est.) ++ 1% (2015 est.) ++ 3.2% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$21,600 (2016 est.) ++ $21,600 (2015 est.) ++ $21,500 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"67.2%","gdp_consumption":"14.2%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"19.3%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"-0.2%","gdp_exports":"22%","gdp_imports":"-22.5% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"6.3%","gdp_sector_industry":"26.1%","gdp_sector_services":"67.6% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"soybeans, rice, wheat;
