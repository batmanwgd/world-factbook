In 1971, six of these states - Abu Dhabi, 'Ajman, Al Fujayrah, Ash Shariqah, Dubayy, and Umm al Qaywayn - merged to form the United Arab Emirates (UAE). They were joined in 1972 by Ra's al Khaymah. The UAE's per capita GDP is on par with those of leading West European nations. For more than three decades, oil and global finance drove the UAE's economy. However, in 2008-09, the confluence of falling oil prices, collapsing real estate prices, and the international banking crisis hit the UAE especially hard. The UAE essentially avoided the \"Arab Spring\" unrest seen elsewhere in the Middle East in 2010-11 and in an effort to stem potential unrest, the government announced a multi-year, $1.6-billion infrastructure investment plan for the poorer northern emirates and aggressively pursued advocates of political reform. The UAE in recent years has played a vital role in regional affairs. In addition to donating billions of dollars in economic aid to help stabilize Egypt, the UAE is a member of a US-led global coalition to defeat the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and a coalition partner in a Saudi-led military campaign to restore the government of Yemen.","communications":{"country_id":"AE","fixed_phones_total":"2,208,425","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"38 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"17.943 million","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"310 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"modern fiber-optic integrated services; digital network with rapidly growing use of mobile-cellular telephones; key centers are Abu Dhabi and Dubai","phone_system_international":"country code - 971; linked to the international submarine cable FLAG (Fiber-Optic Link Around the Globe); landing point for both the SEA-ME-WE-3 and SEA-ME-WE-4 submarine cable networks; satellite earth stations - 3 Intelsat (1 Atlantic Ocean and 2 Indian (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"microwave radio relay, fiber-optic and coaxial cable","broadcast_media":"except for the many organizations now operating in Dubai's Media Free Zone, most TV and radio stations remain government-owned; widespread use of satellite dishes provides access to pan-Arab and other international broadcasts (2007)","internet_country_code":"ae","internet_total_users":"5.274 million","internet_population_percent":"91.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:57","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:57"},"economy":{"country_id":"AE","overview":"The UAE has an open economy with a high per capita income and a sizable annual trade surplus. Successful efforts at economic diversification have reduced the portion of GDP based on oil and gas output to 25%. ++  ++ Since the discovery of oil in the UAE more than 30 years ago, the country has undergone a profound transformation from an impoverished region of small desert principalities to a modern state with a high standard of living. The government has increased spending on job creation and infrastructure expansion and is opening up utilities to greater private sector involvement. The country's free trade zones - offering 100% foreign ownership and zero taxes - are helping to attract foreign investors. ++  ++ The global financial crisis of 2008-09, tight international credit, and deflated asset prices constricted the economy in 2009. UAE authorities tried to blunt the crisis by increasing spending and boosting liquidity in the banking sector. The crisis hit Dubai hardest, as it was heavily exposed to depressed real estate prices. Dubai lacked sufficient cash to meet its debt obligations, prompting global concern about its solvency and ultimately a $20 billion bailout from the UAE Central Bank and Abu Dhabi Government that was refinanced in March 2014. ++  ++ Dependence on oil, a large expatriate workforce, and growing inflation pressures are significant long-term challenges. Low oil prices have prompted the UAE to take steps to reduce its social spending, including eliminating fuel subsidies in August 2015, but the UAE has sufficient assets to cover its deficits with money from its sovereign investment funds. The UAE's strategic plan for the next few years focuses on economic diversification and creating more job opportunities for nationals through improved education and increased private sector employment.","gdp_power_parity":"$667.2 billion (2016 est.) ++ $652.4 billion (2015 est.) ++ $627.6 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"2.3% (2016 est.) ++ 4% (2015 est.) ++ 3.1% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$67,700 (2016 est.) ++ $68,100 (2015 est.) ++ $67,500 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"61.1%","gdp_consumption":"9.3%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"29.7%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"0.7%","gdp_exports":"81.5%","gdp_imports":"-82.3% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"0.7%","gdp_sector_industry":"44.6%","gdp_sector_services":"54.7% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"dates, vegetables, watermelons;
