{"id":"LY","iso_a3":"LBY","fips":"LY","continent":"AF","name":"Libya","introduction":"The Italians supplanted the Ottoman Turks in the area around Tripoli in 1911 and did not relinquish their hold until 1943 when they were defeated in World War II. Libya then passed to UN administration and achieved independence in 1951. Following a 1969 military coup, Col. Muammar al-QADHAFI assumed leadership and began to espouse his political system at home, which was a combination of socialism and Islam. During the 1970s, QADHAFI used oil revenues to promote his ideology outside Libya, supporting subversive and terrorist activities that included the downing of two airliners - one over Scotland, another in Northern Africa - and a discotheque bombing in Berlin. UN sanctions in 1992 isolated QADHAFI politically and economically following the attacks; sanctions were lifted in 2003 following Libyan acceptance of responsibility for the bombings and agreement to claimant compensation. QADHAFI also agreed to end Libya's program to develop weapons of mass destruction, and he made significant strides in normalizing relations with Western nations. ++ Unrest that began in several Middle Eastern and North African countries in late 2010 erupted in Libyan cities in early 2011. QADHAFI's brutal crackdown on protesters spawned a civil war that triggered UN authorization of air and naval intervention by the international community. After months of seesaw fighting between government and opposition forces, the QADHAFI regime was toppled in mid-2011 and replaced by a transitional government. Libya in 2012 formed a new parliament and elected a new prime minister. The country subsequently elected the House of Representatives in 2014, but remnants of the outgoing legislature refused to leave office and created a rival, Islamist-led government, the General National Congress. In October 2015, UN envoy to Libya, Bernardino LEON, proposed a power-sharing arrangement - known as the Libyan Political Agreement, which was signed by the rival governments two months later and subsequently endorsed by the UN. The agreement called for the formation of an interim Government of National Accord or GNA and the holding of general elections within two years. However, as of December 2016, the GNA had not secured House approval and several elements of the Libyan Political Agreement remained stalled, resulting in rival governments continuing to operate independently.","communications":{"country_id":"LY","fixed_phones_total":"632,000","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"10 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"9.918 million","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"155 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"Libya's civil war has disrupted its telecommunications sector, but much of its infrastructure remains superior to that in most other African countries","phone_system_international":"country code - 218; satellite earth stations - 4 Intelsat, NA Arabsat, and NA Intersputnik; submarine cable to France and Italy; microwave radio relay to Tunisia and Egypt; tropospheric scatter to Greece; participant in Medarabtel (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"combined fixed-line and mobile-cellular service generally adequate, but pressure to rebuild damaged infrastructure growing","broadcast_media":"state-funded and private TV stations; some provinces operate local TV stations; pan-Arab satellite TV stations are available; state-funded radio (2012)","internet_country_code":"ly","internet_total_users":"1.219 million","internet_population_percent":"19.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:59","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:59"},"economy":{"country_id":"LY","overview":"Libya's economy, almost entirely dependent on oil and gas exports, struggled during 2015 as the country plunged into civil war and world oil prices dropped to seven-year lows. In early 2015, armed conflict between rival forces for control of the country’s largest oil terminals caused a decline in Libyan crude oil production, which never recovered to more than one-third of the average pre-Revolution highs of 1.6 million barrels per day. The Central Bank of Libya continued to pay government salaries to a majority of the Libyan workforce and to fund subsidies for fuel and food, resulting in an estimated budget deficit of about 49% of GDP.  ++  ++ Libya’s economic transition away from QADHAFI’s notionally socialist model has completely stalled as political chaos persists and security continues to deteriorate. Libya’s leaders have hindered economic development by failing to use its financial resources to invest in national infrastructure. The country suffers from widespread power outages in its largest cities, caused by shortages of fuel for power generation. Living conditions, including access to clean drinking water, medical services, and safe housing, have all declined as the civil war has caused more people to become internally displaced, further straining local resources. ++  ++ Extremists affiliated with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) attacked Libyan oilfields in the first half of 2015; ISIL has a presence in many cities across Libya including near oil infrastructure, threatening future government revenues from oil and gas.","gdp_power_parity":"$90.89 billion (2016 est.) ++ $94.01 billion (2015 est.) ++ $100.4 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"-3.3% (2016 est.) ++ -6.4% (2015 est.) ++ -24% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$14,200 (2016 est.) ++ $14,900 (2015 est.) ++ $16,000 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"84.3%","gdp_consumption":"21.7%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"3.4%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"1.4%","gdp_exports":"32.3%","gdp_imports":"-43.1% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"1.9%","gdp_sector_industry":"43.2%","gdp_sector_services":"54.9% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"wheat, barley, olives, dates, citrus, vegetables, peanuts, soybeans;
