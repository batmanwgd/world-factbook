It has a narrow export base in agricultural goods. Squash, vanilla beans, and yams are the main crops. Agricultural exports, including fish, make up two-thirds of total exports. Tourism is the second-largest source of hard currency earnings following remittances. Tonga had 45,000 visitors in 2013. The country must import a high proportion of its food, mainly from New Zealand. ++  ++ The country remains dependent on external aid and remittances from overseas Tongans to offset its trade deficit. The government is emphasizing the development of the private sector, encouraging investment, and is committing increased funds for healthcare and education. Tonga's English-speaking and educated workforce offer a viable labor market, and the tropical climate provides fertile soil. Renewable energy and deep sea mining also offer opportunities for investment. ++  ++ Tonga has a reasonably sound basic infrastructure and well developed social services. The government faces high unemployment among the young, moderate inflation, pressures for democratic reform, and rising civil service expenditures.","gdp_power_parity":"$557 million (2016 est.) ++ $542.2 million (2015 est.) ++ $524.3 million (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"2.7% (2016 est.) ++ 3.4% (2015 est.) ++ 2.9% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$5,300 (2016 est.) ++ $5,200 (2015 est.) ++ $5,000 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"78.6%","gdp_consumption":"21.4%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"41.3%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"-0.1%","gdp_exports":"19%","gdp_imports":"-60.2% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"19.2%","gdp_sector_industry":"20.6%","gdp_sector_services":"60.1% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"squash, coconuts, copra, bananas, vanilla beans, cocoa, coffee, sweet potatoes, cassava, taro and kava","industries":"tourism, construction, fishing","industrial_growth_rate":"6% (2016 est.)","labor_force":"33,800 (2011 est.)","labor_force_notes":"","labor_force_services":"2,006% (2006 est.)","labor_force_industry":"27.5%","labor_force_agriculture":"27.5%","labor_force_occupation_notes":"","unemployment_rate":"1.1% (2011 est.) ++ 1.1% (2006)","population_below_poverty":"24% (FY03\/04 est.)","household_income_lowest_10":"NA%","household_income_highest_10":"NA%","budget_revenues":"","taxes_revenues":"30.9% of GDP (2016 est.)","budget_net":"0% of GDP (2016 est.)","public_debt":"45.1% of GDP (2013) ++ 46.5% of GDP (2012)","external_debt":"$233.1 million (31 December 2016 est.) ++ $206.2 million (31 December 2015 est.)","fiscal_year":"1 July - 30 June","inflation_rate":"1.2% (2016 est.) ++ -1% (2015 est.)","central_bank_discount_rate":"","commercial_bank_prime_lending_rate":"8% (31 December 2016 est.) ++ 8.09% (31 December 2015 est.)","stock_money_narrow":"$115.6 million (31 December 2016 est.) ++ $101.8 million (31 December 2015 est.)","stock_money_broad":"$218.3 million (31 December 2016 est.) ++ $203.9 million (31 December 2015 est.)","stock_domestic_credit":"$148.4 million (31 December 2016 est.) ++ $128.4 million (31 December 2015 est.)","exports":"$35 million (2016 est.) ++ $30.6 million (2015 est.)","exports_commodities":"squash, fish, vanilla beans, root crops","exports_partners":"Japan 16%, US 15.4%, Fiji 12.8%, NZ 12.5%, South Korea 11%, Samoa 10.7%, Australia 7.5%, American Samoa 6.8% (2015)","imports":"$288.2 million (2016 est.) ++ $263 million (2015 est.)","imports_commodities":"foodstuffs, machinery and transport equipment, fuels, chemicals","imports_partners":"Fiji 37.7%, NZ 21.2%, China 14.2%, US 6.4%, Australia 4.5% (2015)","exchange_rates":"pa'anga (TOP) per US dollar - ++ 2.26 (2016 est.) ++ 2.106 (2015 est.) ++ 2.106 (2014 est.) ++ 1.847 (2013 est.) ++ 1.72 (2012 est.)","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:01","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:01"},"energy":{"country_id":"TN","electricity_production":"50 million kWh (2014 est.)","electricity_consumption":"46.5 million kWh (2014 est.)","electricity_exports":"0 kWh (2013)","electricity_imports":"0 kWh (2013 est.)","electricity_generating_capacity":"17,000 kW (2014 est.)","electricity_fossil_fuels":"100% of total installed capacity (2012 est.)","electricity_nuclear":"0% of total installed capacity (2012 est.)","electricity_hydroelectric":"0% of total installed capacity (2012 est.)","electricity_renewable":"0% of total installed capacity (2012 est.)","crude_oil_production":"0 bbl\/day (2015 est.)","crude_oil_exports":"0 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","crude_oil_imports":"0 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","crude_oil_reserves":"0 bbl (1 January 2010 es)","petrol_production":"0 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","petrol_consumption":"1,500 bbl\/day (2014 est.)","petrol_exports":"0 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","petrol_imports":"1,457 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","natural_gas_production":"0 cu m (2013 est.)","natural_gas_consumption":"0 cu m (2013 est.)","natural_gas_exports":"0 cu m (2013 est.)","natural_gas_imports":"0 cu m (2013 est.)","natural_gas_reserves":"0 cu m (1 January 2014 es)","co2_output":"200,000 Mt (2013 est.)","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:01","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:01"},"geography":{"country_id":"TN","location_description":"Oceania, archipelago in the South Pacific Ocean, about two-thirds of the way from Hawaii to New Zealand","latitude":"33.8869170","longitude":"9.5374990","mapReferences":"Oceania","area_sqkm_total":747,"area_sqkm_land":717,"area_sqkm_water":30,"area_km_coastline":419,"area_note":"four times the size of Washington, DC","climate":"tropical;
