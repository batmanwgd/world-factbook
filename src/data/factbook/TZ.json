One-party rule ended in 1995 with the first democratic elections held in the country since the 1970s. Zanzibar's semi-autonomous status and popular opposition led to two contentious elections since 1995, which the ruling party won despite international observers' claims of voting irregularities. The formation of a government of national unity between Zanzibar's two leading parties succeeded in minimizing electoral tension in 2010.","communications":{"country_id":"TZ","fixed_phones_total":"142,819","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"less than 1 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"39.666 million","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"78 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"telecommunications services are marginal; system operating below capacity and being modernized for better service","phone_system_international":"country code - 255; landing point for the EASSy fiber-optic submarine cable system linking East Africa with Europe and North America; satellite earth stations - 2 Intelsat (1 Indian Ocean, 1 Atlantic Ocean) (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"fixed-line telephone network inadequate with less than 1 connection per 100 persons; mobile-cellular service, aided by multiple providers, is increasing rapidly and exceeds 75 telephones per 100 persons; trunk service provided by open-wire, microwave radi","broadcast_media":"a state-owned TV station and multiple privately owned TV stations; state-owned national radio station supplemented by more than 40 privately owned radio stations; transmissions of several international broadcasters are available (2007)","internet_country_code":"tz","internet_total_users":"2.734 million","internet_population_percent":"5.4","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:01","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:01"},"economy":{"country_id":"TZ","overview":"Tanzania is one of the world's poorest economies in terms of per capita income, but has achieved high growth rates based on its vast natural resource wealth and tourism. GDP growth in 2009-15 was an impressive 6-7% per year. Dar es Salaam used fiscal stimulus measures and easier monetary policies to lessen the impact of the global recession. Tanzania has largely completed its transition to a market economy, though the government retains a presence in sectors such as telecommunications, banking, energy, and mining. ++  ++ The economy depends on agriculture, which accounts for more than one-quarter of GDP, provides 85% of exports, and employs about 80% of the work force; agriculture accounts for 7% of government expenditures. All land in Tanzania is owned by the government, which can lease land for up to 99 years. Proposed reforms to allow for land ownership, particularly foreign land ownership, remain unpopular. ++  ++ The financial sector in Tanzania has expanded in recent years and foreign-owned banks account for about 48% of the banking industry's total assets. Competition among foreign commercial banks has resulted in significant improvements in the efficiency and quality of financial services, though interest rates are still relatively high, reflecting high fraud risk. Recent banking reforms have helped increase private-sector growth and investment. ++  ++ The World Bank, the IMF, and bilateral donors have provided funds to rehabilitate Tanzania's aging infrastructure, including rail and port, that provide important trade links for inland countries. In 2013, Tanzania completed the world's largest Millennium Challenge Compact grant, worth $698 million, and, in December 2014, the Millennium Challenge Corporation selected Tanzania for a second Compact. ++  ++ In late 2014, a highly publicized scandal in the energy sector involving senior Tanzanian officials resulted in international donors freezing nearly $500 million in direct budget support to the government. The Tanzanian shilling weakened in 2015 because of lower gold prices, election-related political risk, and outflows from emerging market currencies generally.","gdp_power_parity":"$150.6 billion (2016 est.) ++ $140.6 billion (2015 est.) ++ $131.4 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"7.2% (2016 est.) ++ 7% (2015 est.) ++ 7% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$3,100 (2016 est.) ++ $2,900 (2015 est.) ++ $2,800 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"62.3%","gdp_consumption":"13.4%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"36.5%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"-5.9%","gdp_exports":"22.9%","gdp_imports":"-29.2% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"25.1%","gdp_sector_industry":"27.6%","gdp_sector_services":"47.3% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"coffee, sisal, tea, cotton, pyrethrum (insecticide made from chrysanthemums), cashew nuts, tobacco, cloves, corn, wheat, cassava (manioc, tapioca), bananas, fruits, vegetables;
