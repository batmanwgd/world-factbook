The islands were part of the British colony of the Leeward Islands from 1872-1960; they were granted autonomy in 1967. The economy is closely tied to the larger and more populous US Virgin Islands to the west; the US dollar is the legal currency.","communications":null,"economy":null,"energy":null,"geography":null,"government":null,"issues":null,"people":null,"ethnicities":null,"religions":null,"transportation":null}
