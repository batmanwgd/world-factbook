In 1918, the Croats, Serbs, and Slovenes formed a kingdom known after 1929 as Yugoslavia. Following World War II, Yugoslavia became a federal independent communist state under the strong hand of Marshal TITO. Although Croatia declared its independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, it took four years of sporadic, but often bitter, fighting before occupying Serb armies were mostly cleared from Croatian lands, along with a majority of Croatia's ethnic Serb population. Under UN supervision, the last Serb-held enclave in eastern Slavonia was returned to Croatia in 1998. The country joined NATO in April 2009 and the EU in July 2013.","communications":{"country_id":"HR","fixed_phones_total":"1,476,506","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"33 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"4.416 million","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"99 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"the telecommunications network has improved steadily since the mid-1990s, covering much of what were once inaccessible areas; local lines are digital","phone_system_international":"country code - 385; digital international service is provided through the main switch in Zagreb; Croatia participates in the Trans-Asia-Europe fiber-optic project, which consists of 2 fiber-optic trunk connections with Slovenia and a fiber-optic trunk lin (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"fixed-line teledensity has droped somewhat to about 35 per 100 persons; mobile-cellular telephone subscriptions now even with the population","broadcast_media":"the national state-owned public broadcaster, Croatian Radiotelevision, operates 4 terrestrial TV networks, a satellite channel that rebroadcasts programs for Croatians living abroad, and 6 regional TV centers; 2 private broadcasters operate national terre (2012)","internet_country_code":"hr","internet_total_users":"3.117 million","internet_population_percent":"69.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:59","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:59"},"economy":{"country_id":"HR","overview":"Though still one of the wealthiest of the former Yugoslav republics, Croatia's economy suffered badly during the 1991-95 war. The country's output during that time collapsed, and Croatia missed the early waves of investment in Central and Eastern Europe that followed the fall of the Berlin Wall. Between 2000 and 2007, however, Croatia's economic fortunes began to improve with moderate but steady GDP growth between 4% and 6% led by a rebound in tourism and credit-driven consumer spending. Inflation over the same period remained tame and the currency, the kuna, stable. ++  ++ Croatia experienced an abrupt slowdown in the economy in 2008 and has yet to recover; economic growth was stagnant or negative in each year since 2009. Difficult problems still remain including a stubbornly high unemployment rate, uneven regional development, and a challenging investment climate. Croatia continues to face reduced foreign investment. ++  ++ On 1 July 2013, Croatia joined the EU, following a decade-long application process. Croatia will be a member of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism until it meets the criteria for joining the Economic and Monetary Union and adopts the euro as its currency. EU accession has increased pressure on the government to reduce Croatia’s relatively high public debt, which triggered the EU’s excessive deficit procedure for fiscal consolidation. Zagreb has cut spending since 2012, and the government also raised additional revenues through more stringent tax collection and by raising the value-added tax. The government has also sought to accelerate privatization of non-strategic assets, with mixed success.","gdp_power_parity":"$94.24 billion (2016 est.) ++ $92.48 billion (2015 est.) ++ $90.98 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"1.9% (2016 est.) ++ 1.6% (2015 est.) ++ -0.4% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$22,400 (2016 est.) ++ $21,900 (2015 est.) ++ $21,500 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"59.1%","gdp_consumption":"19.3%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"19.1%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"-0.4%","gdp_exports":"50.8%","gdp_imports":"-47.9% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"4.2%","gdp_sector_industry":"26.6%","gdp_sector_services":"69.2% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"arable crops (wheat, corn, barley, sugar beet, sunflower, rapeseed, alfalfa, clover);
