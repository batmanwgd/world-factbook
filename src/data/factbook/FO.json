The islands have been connected politically to Denmark since the 14th century.

The Faroe Islands are not part of the European Union.","communications":{"country_id":"FO","fixed_phones_total":"17,000","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"34 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"63,000","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"126 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"good international communications; good domestic facilities","phone_system_international":"country code - 298; satellite earth stations - 1 Orion; 1 fiber-optic submarine cable to the Shetland Islands, linking the Faroe Islands with Denmark and Iceland; fiber-optic submarine cable connection to Canada-Europe cable (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"conversion to digital system completed in 1998; both NMT (analog) and GSM (digital) mobile telephone systems are installed","broadcast_media":"1 publicly owned TV station; the Faroese telecommunications company distributes local and international channels through its digital terrestrial network; publicly owned radio station supplemented by 3 privately owned stations broadcasting over multiple fr (2015)","internet_country_code":"fo","internet_total_users":"47,000","internet_population_percent":"94.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58"},"economy":{"country_id":"FO","overview":"The Faroese economy has experienced a period of significant growth since 2011, due to increases in fish prices, salmon farming, and catches in the pelagic fisheries. Nominal GDP growth was an estimated 7.5% in 2013 and 5.9% in 2014. The fisheries sector accounts for about 95% of exports and half of GDP. Unemployment is low, estimated at 2.9% in mid-2015. ++  ++ The public budget has exhibited deficits since 2008, which were financed through increased borrowing. Public debt reached 38% of GDP in 2015. Aided by an annual subsidy from Denmark amounting to about 4% of Faroese GDP, the Faroese have a standard of living equal to that of Denmark. ++  ++ Dependence on fishing makes the economy vulnerable to price fluctuations. Projections for fish prices are favorable and increasing public infrastructure investments are likely to lead to continued growth in the short term.","gdp_power_parity":"$1.831 billion (2014 est.) ++ $1.729 billion (2013 est.) ++ $1.471 billion (2013 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"5.9% (2014 est.) ++ 7.5% (2013 est.) ++ 2.9% (2013 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$36,600 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"","gdp_consumption":"","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"","gdp_exports":"","gdp_imports":"","gdp_sector_agriculture":"16%","gdp_sector_industry":"29%","gdp_sector_services":"55% (2007 est.)","agriculture_products":"milk, potatoes, vegetables;
