Services include operating the Panama Canal, logistics, banking, the Colon Free Trade Zone, insurance, container ports, flagship registry, and tourism. Panama's transportation and logistics services sectors, along with infrastructure development projects, have boosted economic growth; however, public debt surpassed $32 billion in 2015 because of excessive government spending and public works projects. The US-Panama Trade Promotion Agreement was approved by Congress and signed into law in October 2011, and entered into force in October 2012. ++  ++ Growth will be bolstered by the Panama Canal expansion project that began in 2007 and is estimated to be completed by 2016 at a cost of $5.3 billion - about 10-15% of current GDP. The expansion project will more than double the Canal's capacity, enabling it to accommodate ships that are too large to traverse the existing canal. The US and China are the top users of the Canal. In 2014, Panama completed a metro system in Panama City, valued at $1.2 billion. ++  ++ Strong economic performance has not translated into broadly shared prosperity, as Panama has the second worst income distribution in Latin America. About one-fourth of the population lives in poverty; however, from 2006 to 2012 poverty was reduced by 10 percentage points.","gdp_power_parity":"$93.12 billion (2016 est.) ++ $88.52 billion (2015 est.) ++ $83.69 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"5.2% (2016 est.) ++ 5.8% (2015 est.) ++ 6.1% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$22,800 (2016 est.) ++ $22,100 (2015 est.) ++ $21,300 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"49.7%","gdp_consumption":"9.4%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"43.9%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"3.3%","gdp_exports":"52%","gdp_imports":"-58.3% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"2.7%","gdp_sector_industry":"14.3%","gdp_sector_services":"83% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"bananas, rice, corn, coffee, sugarcane, vegetables;
