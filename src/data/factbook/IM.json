{"id":"IM","iso_a3":"IMN","fips":"IM","continent":"EU","name":"Isle of Man","introduction":"Part of the Norwegian Kingdom of the Hebrides until the 13th century when it was ceded to Scotland, the isle came under the British Crown in 1765. Current concerns include reviving the almost extinct Manx Gaelic language. Isle of Man is a British Crown dependency but is not part of the UK or of the EU. However, the UK Government remains constitutionally responsible for its defense and international representation.","communications":{"country_id":"IM","fixed_phones_total":"","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"","mobile_phones_total":"","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"","phone_system_general_assessment":"","phone_system_international":"country code - 44; fiber-optic cable, microwave radio relay, satellite earth station, submarine cable","phone_system_domestic":"landline, telefax, mobile cellular telephone system","broadcast_media":"national public radio broadcasts over 3 FM stations and 1 AM station; 2 commercial broadcasters operating with 1 having multiple FM stations; receives radio and TV services via relays from British TV and radio broadcasters (2008)","internet_country_code":"im","internet_total_users":"","internet_population_percent":"0.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:59","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:59"},"economy":{"country_id":"IM","overview":"Financial services, manufacturing, and tourism are key sectors of the economy. The government offers low taxes and other incentives to high-technology companies and financial institutions to locate on the island; this has paid off in expanding employment opportunities in high-income industries. As a result, agriculture and fishing, once the mainstays of the economy, have declined in their contributions to GDP. The Isle of Man also attracts online gambling sites and the film industry. Online gambling sites provided about 10% of the islands income in 2014. The Isle of Man enjoys free access to EU markets and trade is mostly with the UK. In October 2014, the Isle of Man signed an OECD agreement to automatically exchange some financial account information to limit tax avoidance and evasion.","gdp_power_parity":"$6.298 billion (FY12\/13 est.) ++ $5.85 billion (FY11\/12 est.) ++ $5.621 billion (FY10\/11 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"2.2% (2012) ++ 3.4% (2011) ++ 2.1% (2010)","gdp_per_capita":"$83,100 (2007 est.) ++ $35,000 (2005 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"","gdp_consumption":"","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"","gdp_exports":"","gdp_imports":"","gdp_sector_agriculture":"1%","gdp_sector_industry":"13%","gdp_sector_services":"86% (FY12\/13 est.)","agriculture_products":"cereals, vegetables;
