Zambia’s lack of economic diversification and dependency on copper as its sole major export makes it vulnerable to fluctuations in the world commodities market and prices turned downward in 2015 due to declining demand from China; Zambia was overtaken by the Democratic Republic of Congo as Africa’s largest copper producer. ++  ++ Despite recent strong economic growth and its status as a lower middle-income country, widespread and extreme rural poverty and high unemployment levels remain significant problems, made worse by a high birth rate, a relatively high HIV\/AIDS burden, and by market-distorting agricultural and energy policies. Economic policy inconsistency and poor budget execution in recent years has hindered the economy and contributed to weakness in the kwacha, which was Africa’s worst performing currency during 2015. Zambia has raised $7 billion from international investors by issuing separate sovereign bonds in September 2012, April 2014, and July 2015, significantly increasing the country’s public debt as a share of GDP. ++  ++ Poor management of water resources has also contributed to a power generation shortage, which has hampered industrial productivity and contributed to an increase in year-on-year inflation to 23% by March 2016. Zambia’s currency, the kwacha, also depreciated sharply against the dollar through 2015, before the central bank restricted lending.","gdp_power_parity":"$65.17 billion (2016 est.) ++ $63.27 billion (2015 est.) ++ $61.43 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"3% (2016 est.) ++ 3% (2015 est.) ++ 5% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$3,900 (2016 est.) ++ $3,900 (2015 est.) ++ $3,900 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"53%","gdp_consumption":"21.7%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"26%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"1.2%","gdp_exports":"43.8%","gdp_imports":"-45.7% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"9.2%","gdp_sector_industry":"29.2%","gdp_sector_services":"61.7% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"corn, sorghum, rice, peanuts, sunflower seeds, vegetables, flowers, tobacco, cotton, sugarcane, cassava (manioc, tapioca), coffee;
