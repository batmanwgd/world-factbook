The island staunchly supported the UK through both world wars and remained in the Commonwealth when it became independent in 1964; a decade later it declared itself a republic. Since about the mid-1980s, the island has transformed itself into a freight transshipment point, a financial center, and a tourist destination while its key industries moved toward more service-oriented activities. Malta became an EU member in May 2004 and began using the euro as currency in 2008.","communications":{"country_id":"MT","fixed_phones_total":"230,226","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"56 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"558,000","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"135 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"automatic system featuring submarine cable and microwave radio relay between islands","phone_system_international":"country code - 356; submarine cable connects to Italy; satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean) (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"combined fixed-line and mobile-cellular subscribership exceeds 190 per 100 persons","broadcast_media":"2 publicly owned TV stations, Television Malta broadcasting nationally plus an educational channel; several privately owned national television stations, two of which are owned by political parties; Italian and British broadcast programs are available; mu (2016)","internet_country_code":"mt","internet_total_users":"315,000","internet_population_percent":"76.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:00","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:00"},"economy":{"country_id":"MT","overview":"Malta - the smallest economy in the euro zone - produces only about 20% of its food needs, has limited fresh water supplies, and has few domestic energy sources. Malta's economy is dependent on foreign trade, manufacturing, and tourism. Malta joined the EU in 2004 and adopted the euro on 1 January 2008. ++  ++ Malta has weathered the euro-zone crisis better than most EU member states due to a low debt-to-GDP ratio and financially sound banking sector. It has low unemployment relative to other European countries, and growth has recovered since the 2009 recession. In 2014 and 2015, Malta led the euro zone in growth, expanding by nearly 3.5% each year. ++  ++ Malta’s services sector continued to grow in 2015, with noted increases in the financial services and online gaming sectors. Malta continues to enhance its regulation of the financial services sector, and passed additional legislation in 2014 and 2015 to improve anti-money laundering oversight for financial and gaming activities. Expanding EU discussions of anti-tax avoidance measures, including the “Anti-Tax Avoidance Package” submitted in early 2016, have raised concerns among Malta’s financial services and insurance providers about passage of laws governing EU tax practices, which could have a significant impact on those sectors. ++  ++ Malta’s 2015 GDP growth was bolstered by energy infrastructure investments, and revenue growth is expected to continue, supported by a strong labor market and proceeds from a citizenship by investment program equal to roughly 0.9% of GDP. Malta's geographic position between Europe and North Africa makes it a route for irregular migration. Historically, Malta's fertility rate has been below the EU average, and population growth in recent years has been largely from immigration, increasing pressure on the pension system. The government has implemented new programs, including free childcare, to encourage increased labor participation. The high cost of borrowing and small labor market remain potential constraints to future economic growth.","gdp_power_parity":"$16.32 billion (2016 est.) ++ $15.68 billion (2015 est.) ++ $14.77 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"4.1% (2016 est.) ++ 6.2% (2015 est.) ++ 3.5% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$37,900 (2016 est.) ++ $36,500 (2015 est.) ++ $34,700 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"52.4%","gdp_consumption":"19.5%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"24.6%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"0.4%","gdp_exports":"135.6%","gdp_imports":"-132.5% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"1.4%","gdp_sector_industry":"11.4%","gdp_sector_services":"87.2% (2015 est.)","agriculture_products":"potatoes, cauliflower, grapes, wheat, barley, tomatoes, citrus, cut flowers, green peppers;
