{"id":"NG","iso_a3":"NGA","fips":"NI","continent":"AF","name":"Nigeria","introduction":"British influence and control over what would become Nigeria and Africa's most populous country grew through the 19th century. A series of constitutions after World War II granted Nigeria greater autonomy. After independence in 1960, politics were marked by coups and mostly military rule, until the death of a military head of state in 1998 allowed for a political transition. In 1999, a new constitution was adopted and a peaceful transition to civilian government was completed. The government continues to face the daunting task of institutionalizing democracy and reforming a petroleum-based economy, whose revenues have been squandered through corruption and mismanagement. In addition, Nigeria continues to experience longstanding ethnic and religious tensions. Although both the 2003 and 2007 presidential elections were marred by significant irregularities and violence, Nigeria is currently experiencing its longest period of civilian rule since independence. The general elections of April 2007 marked the first civilian-to-civilian transfer of power in the country's history and the elections of 2011 were generally regarded as credible. The 2015 election is considered the most well run in Nigeria since the return to civilian rule, with the umbrella opposition party, the All Progressives Congress, defeating the long-ruling People's Democratic Party that had governed since 1999.","communications":{"country_id":"NG","fixed_phones_total":"110,000","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"1 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"8.959 million","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"50 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"inadequate; small system of wire, radio telephone communications, and microwave radio relay links concentrated in southwestern Niger","phone_system_international":"country code - 227; satellite earth stations - 2 Intelsat (1 Atlantic Ocean and 1 Indian Ocean) (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"combined fixed-line and mobile-cellular teledensity remains only about 50 per 100 persons despite a rapidly increasing cellular subscribership base; domestic satellite system with 3 earth stations and 1 planned","broadcast_media":"state-run TV station; 3 private TV stations provide a mix of local and foreign programming; state-run radio has only radio station with national coverage; about 30 private radio stations operate locally; as many as 100 community radio stations broadcast; (2007)","internet_country_code":"ne","internet_total_users":"401,000","internet_population_percent":"2.2","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:00","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:00"},"economy":{"country_id":"NG","overview":"Niger is a landlocked, sub-Saharan nation, whose economy centers on subsistence crops, livestock, and some of the world's largest uranium deposits. Agriculture contributes nearly 40% of GDP and provides livelihood for most of the population. The UN ranked Niger as the least developed country in the world in 2015 due to multiple factors such as food insecurity, lack of industry, high population growth, a weak educational sector, and few prospects for work outside of subsistence farming and herding. ++  ++ Since 2011 public debt has increased due to efforts to scale-up public investment, particularly that related to infrastructure. The government relies on foreign donor resources for a large portion of its fiscal budget. The economy in recent years has been hurt by terrorist activity and kidnappings near its uranium mines and by instability in Mali and in the Diffa region of the country; concerns about security have resulted in increased support from regional and international partners on defense. Low uranium prices, demographics, and security expenditures may continue to put pressure on the government’s finances. ++  ++ Future growth may be sustained by exploitation of oil, gold, coal, and other mineral resources. Although Niger has sizable reserves of oil, the profitability of these commodities has been called in to question due to the prolonged drop in oil prices. Food insecurity and drought remain perennial problems for Niger, and the government plans to invest a little more in the agriculture sector, most notably irrigation. Niger’s three-year $131 million IMF Extended Credit Facility agreement for years 2012-15 was extended until the end of 2016, although formal private sector investment needed for economic diversification and growth remains a challenge, given the country’s limited domestic markets, access to credit, and competitiveness.","gdp_power_parity":"$20.27 billion (2016 est.) ++ $19.26 billion (2015 est.) ++ $18.6 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"5.2% (2016 est.) ++ 3.5% (2015 est.) ++ 7.1% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$1,100 (2016 est.) ++ $1,100 (2015 est.) ++ $1,100 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"66.6%","gdp_consumption":"15.5%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"39.6%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"0.1%","gdp_exports":"16.7%","gdp_imports":"-38.5% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"36.5%","gdp_sector_industry":"18.5%","gdp_sector_services":"45% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"cowpeas, cotton, peanuts, millet, sorghum, cassava (manioc, tapioca), rice;
