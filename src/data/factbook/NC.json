The agreement also commits France to conduct a referendum between 2014 and 2018 to decide whether New Caledonia should assume full sovereignty and independence.","communications":{"country_id":"NC","fixed_phones_total":"92,000","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"34 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"246,000","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"91 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"a submarine cable network connection between New Caledonia and Australia, completed in 2007, increased network capacity and improved high-speed connectivity and access to international networks","phone_system_international":"country code - 687; satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat (Pacific Ocean) (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"combined fixed-line and mobile-cellular telephone subscribership exceeds 120 per 100 persons","broadcast_media":"the publicly owned French Overseas Network (RFO), which operates in France's overseas departments and territories, broadcasts over the RFO Nouvelle Caledonie TV and radio stations; a small number of privately owned radio stations also broadcast (2008)","internet_country_code":"nc","internet_total_users":"201,000","internet_population_percent":"74.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:00","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:00"},"economy":{"country_id":"NC","overview":"New Caledonia has about 25% of the world's known nickel reserves. Only a small amount of the land is suitable for cultivation, and food accounts for about 20% of imports. In addition to nickel, substantial financial support from France - equal to more than 15% of GDP - and tourism are keys to the health of the economy. ++  ++ During 2009-10, France sent more development assistance to New Caledonia than to any of its other overseas territories. In October 2014, French Prime Minster Manuel VALLS confirmed financial support to New Caledonia totaling $500 million for the period 2016-20. The new government, which inherited a $112 million deficit in 2013, is expected to focus on bringing the territory’s budget back into balance. ++  ++ Substantial new investment in the nickel industry — including two major new plants - combined with the recovery of global nickel prices, has brightened the economic outlook for the next several years. In 2015, New Caledonia helped fill China’s shortfall in nickel supplies left by an Indonesian ban on nickel ore exports.","gdp_power_parity":"$11.1 billion (2014 est.) ++ $10.8 billion (2013 est.) ++ $10.57 billion (2012)","gdp_real_growth":"2.8% (2014 est.) ++ 2.2% (2013) ++ 2.9% (2012)","gdp_per_capita":"$38,800 (2012 est.) ++ $36,500 (2010 est.) ++ $27,300 (2005)","gdp_household_consumption":"63.2%","gdp_consumption":"24.1%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"40.5%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"0%","gdp_exports":"20%","gdp_imports":"-47.8% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"1.5%","gdp_sector_industry":"25.1%","gdp_sector_services":"73.4% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"vegetables;
