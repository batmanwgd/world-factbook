{"id":"MN","iso_a3":"MNG","fips":"MG","continent":"AS","name":"Mongolia","introduction":"The Mongols gained fame in the 13th century when under Chinggis KHAAN they established a huge Eurasian empire through conquest. After his death the empire was divided into several powerful Mongol states, but these broke apart in the 14th century. The Mongols eventually retired to their original steppe homelands and in the late 17th century came under Chinese rule. Mongolia won its independence in 1921 with Soviet backing and a communist regime was installed in 1924. The modern country of Mongolia, however, represents only part of the Mongols' historical homeland; today, more ethnic Mongolians live in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in the People's Republic of China than in Mongolia. Following a peaceful democratic revolution in 1990, the ex-communist Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP) - which took the name Mongolian People’s Party (MPP) in 2010 - has competed for political power with the Democratic Party (DP), the main opposition party, and several other smaller parties, including a new party formed by former President ENKHBAYAR, which confusingly adopted for itself the MPRP name. In its most recent Parliamentary elections in June 2016, Mongolians handed the MPP overwhelming control of Parliament, largely pushing out the DP, which had overseen a sharp decline in Mongolia’s economy during its control of Parliament in the preceding years. President ELBEGDORJ, a DP member, will finish his second term as president in 2017, and is not eligible to run for reelection.","communications":{"country_id":"MN","fixed_phones_total":"49,085","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"130 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"34,000","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"90 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"modern automatic telephone system; the country's sole fixed-line operator offers a full range of services to residential and business customers","phone_system_international":"country code - 377; no satellite earth stations; connected by cable into the French communications system (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"combined fixed-line and mobile-cellular teledensity exceeds 200 per 100 persons","broadcast_media":"TV Monte-Carlo operates a TV network; cable TV available; Radio Monte-Carlo has extensive radio networks in France and Italy with French-language broadcasts to France beginning in the 1960s and Italian-language broadcasts to Italy beginning in the 1970s; (2012)","internet_country_code":"mc","internet_total_users":"35,000","internet_population_percent":"93.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:00","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:00"},"economy":{"country_id":"MN","overview":"Monaco, bordering France on the Mediterranean coast, is a popular resort, attracting tourists to its casino and pleasant climate. The principality also is a banking center and has successfully sought to diversify into services and small, high-value-added, nonpolluting industries. The state retains monopolies in a number of sectors, including tobacco, the telephone network, and the postal service. Living standards are high, roughly comparable to those in prosperous French metropolitan areas. ++  ++ The state has no income tax and low business taxes and thrives as a tax haven both for individuals who have established residence and for foreign companies that have set up businesses and offices. Monaco, however, is not a tax-free shelter; it charges nearly 20% value-added tax, collects stamp duties, and companies face a 33% tax on profits unless they can show that three-quarters of profits are generated within the principality. Monaco was formally removed from the OECD's \"grey list\" of uncooperative tax jurisdictions in late 2009, but continues to face international pressure to abandon its banking secrecy laws and help combat tax evasion. In October 2014, Monaco officially became the 84th jurisdiction participating in the OECD’s Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, an effort to combat offshore tax avoidance and evasion. ++  ++ Monaco's reliance on tourism and banking for its economic growth has left it vulnerable to a downturn in France and other European economies which are the principality's main trade partners. In 2009, Monaco's GDP fell by 11.5% as the euro-zone crisis precipitated a sharp drop in tourism and retail activity and home sales. A modest recovery ensued in 2010 and intensified in 2013, with GDP growth of more than 9%, but Monaco's economic prospects remain uncertain, and tied to future euro-zone growth.","gdp_power_parity":"$6.79 billion (2013 est.) ++ $6.213 billion (2012 est.) ++ $5.748 billion (2011 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"9.3% (2013 est.) ++ 1.2% (2012 est.) ++ 7% (2011 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$78,700 (2013 est.) ++ $73,200 (2012 est.) ++ $72,600 (2011 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"","gdp_consumption":"","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"","gdp_exports":"","gdp_imports":"","gdp_sector_agriculture":"0%","gdp_sector_industry":"14%","gdp_sector_services":"86% (2013)","agriculture_products":"none","industries":"banking, insurance, tourism, construction, small-scale industrial and consumer products","industrial_growth_rate":"20% (2013)","labor_force":"52,000","labor_force_notes":"includes all foreign workers (2014 est.)","labor_force_services":"83.9% (2012 est.)","labor_force_industry":"16.1%","labor_force_agriculture":"0%","labor_force_occupation_notes":"","unemployment_rate":"2% (2012)","population_below_poverty":"NA%","household_income_lowest_10":"NA%","household_income_highest_10":"NA%","budget_revenues":"","taxes_revenues":"17.7% of GDP (2011 est.)","budget_net":"-1.1% of GDP (2011 est.)","public_debt":"","external_debt":"$NA","fiscal_year":"calendar year","inflation_rate":"1.5% (2010)","central_bank_discount_rate":"","commercial_bank_prime_lending_rate":"","stock_money_narrow":"","stock_money_broad":"","stock_domestic_credit":"","exports":"$1.115 billion (2011) ++ $684.9 million (2010)","exports_commodities":"","exports_partners":"Europe 73.2%, Africa 14.6%, America 5.2%, Asia 4.9% (2013 est.)","imports":"$1.162 billion (2011) ++ $850.2 million (2010)","imports_commodities":"","imports_partners":"Europe 70.4%, Asia 20.8%, America 4.4%, Africa 4.1% (2013 est.)","exchange_rates":"euros (EUR) per US dollar - ++ 0.9214 (2016 est.) ++ 0.885 (2015 est.) ++ 0.885 (2014 est.) ++ 0.7634 (2013 est.) ++ 0.78 (2012 est.)","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:00","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:00"},"energy":null,"geography":{"country_id":"MN","location_description":"Western Europe, bordering the Mediterranean Sea on the southern coast of France, near the border with Italy","latitude":"46.8624960","longitude":"103.8466560","mapReferences":"Europe","area_sqkm_total":2,"area_sqkm_land":2,"area_sqkm_water":0,"area_km_coastline":4,"area_note":"about three times the size of the National Mall in Washington, DC","climate":"Mediterranean with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers","terrain":"hilly, rugged, rocky","hazards":"NA","notes":"second-smallest independent state in the world (after the Holy See);
