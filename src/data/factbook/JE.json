These islands were the only British soil occupied by German troops in World War II. Jersey is a British Crown dependency but is not part of the UK or of the EU. However, the UK Government is constitutionally responsible for its defense and international representation.","communications":{"country_id":"JE","fixed_phones_total":"73,800","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"80 (July 2010 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"112,400","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"117 (July 2013 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"modern system with broadband access","phone_system_international":"country code - 44; submarine cable connectivity to Guernsey, the UK, and France (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"fixed-line and mobile-cellular services widely available","broadcast_media":"multiple UK terrestrial TV broadcasts are received via a transmitter in Jersey; satellite packages available; BBC Radio Jersey and 1 other radio station operating (2009)","internet_country_code":"je","internet_total_users":"58,000","internet_population_percent":"59.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:59","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:59"},"economy":{"country_id":"JE","overview":"Jersey's economy is based on international financial services, agriculture, and tourism. In 2010, the financial services sector accounted for about 50% of the island's output. Potatoes, cauliflower, tomatoes, and especially flowers are important export crops, shipped mostly to the UK. The Jersey breed of dairy cattle is known worldwide and represents an important export income earner. Tourism accounts for one-quarter of GDP. Living standards come close to those of the UK. In recent years, the government has encouraged light industry to locate in Jersey with the result that an electronics industry has developed, displacing more traditional industries. All raw material and energy requirements are imported as well as a large share of Jersey's food needs. Light taxes and death duties make the island a popular tax haven. In October 2014, Jersey signed an OECD agreement to automatically exchange some financial account information to limit tax avoidance and evasion.","gdp_power_parity":"$5.771 billion (FY12\/13 est.) ++ $5.786 billion (FY11\/12)","gdp_real_growth":"-0.3% (FY12\/13 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$57,000 (2005 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"","gdp_consumption":"","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"","gdp_exports":"","gdp_imports":"","gdp_sector_agriculture":"2%","gdp_sector_industry":"2%","gdp_sector_services":"96% (2010)","agriculture_products":"potatoes, cauliflower, tomatoes;
