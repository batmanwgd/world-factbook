{"id":"MK","iso_a3":"MKD","fips":"MK","continent":"EU","name":"Macedonia","introduction":"Macedonia gained its independence peacefully from Yugoslavia in 1991. Greek objection to Macedonia’s name, insisting it implies territorial pretensions to the northern Greek province of the same name, and democratic backsliding have stalled the country’s movement toward Euro-Atlantic integration. Immediately after Macedonia declared independence, Greece sought to block Macedonian efforts to gain UN membership if the name “Macedonia” was used. Macedonia was eventually admitted to the UN in 1993 as “The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,” and at the same time it agreed to UN-sponsored negotiations on the name dispute. In 1995, Greece lifted a 20-month trade embargo and the two countries agreed to normalize relations, but the issue of the name remained unresolved and negotiations for a solution are ongoing. Since 2004, the US and over 130 other nations have recognized Macedonia by its constitutional name, Republic of Macedonia. Ethnic Albanian grievances over perceived political and economic inequities escalated into an insurgency in 2001 that eventually led to the internationally brokered Ohrid Framework Agreement (OFA), which ended the fighting and established guidelines for constitutional amendments and the creation of new laws that enhanced the rights of minorities. Relations between Macedonians and ethnic Albanians remain fragile, however. ++ Macedonia has been engulfed in a political crisis that began after the 2014 legislative and presidential election, and which escalated in 2015 when opposition party began releasing wiretap content that it alleged showed widespread government corruption. Although Macedonia became an EU candidate in 2005, the country still faces challenges, including overcoming the political crisis, fully implementing OFA, resolving the outstanding name dispute with Greece, improving relations with Bulgaria, halting democratic backsliding, and stimulating economic growth and development. At the 2008 NATO Summit in Bucharest, Romania, the Allies agreed that Macedonia would be invited to join the Alliance as soon as a mutually acceptable resolution to the name dispute was reached with Greece.","communications":{"country_id":"MK","fixed_phones_total":"372,557","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"18 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"2.223 million","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"106 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"competition from the mobile-cellular segment of the telecommunications market has led to a drop in fixed-line telephone subscriptions","phone_system_international":"country code - 389 (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"combined fixed-line and mobile-cellular telephone subscribership about 120 per 100 persons","broadcast_media":"public TV broadcaster operates 3 national channels and a satellite network; 5 privately owned TV channels broadcast nationally using terrestrial transmitters and about 15 broadcast on national level via satellite; roughly 75 local commercial TV stations; (2012)","internet_country_code":"mk","internet_total_users":"","internet_population_percent":"0.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:59","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:59"},"economy":{"country_id":"MK","overview":"Since its independence in 1991, Macedonia has made progress in liberalizing its economy and improving its business environment, but has lagged the Balkan region in attracting foreign investment. Corruption and weak rule of law remain significant problems. Some businesses complain of opaque regulations and unequal enforcement of the law. ++  ++ Macedonia’s economy is closely linked to Europe as a customer for exports and source of investment, and has suffered as a result of prolonged weakness in the euro zone. Unemployment has remained consistently high at about 30% since 2008, but may be overstated based on the existence of an extensive gray market, estimated to be between 20% and 45% of GDP, which is not captured by official statistics. ++  ++ Macedonia maintained macroeconomic stability through the global financial crisis by conducting prudent monetary policy, which keeps the domestic currency pegged against the euro, and by limiting fiscal deficits. The government has been loosening fiscal policy, however, and the budget deficit was 4.2% of GDP in both 2013 and 2014, gradually falling to 3.7% in 2015. By yearend 2015, public debt was 40.3%, which although low by regional comparison, is significant for a small economy.","gdp_power_parity":"$30.13 billion (2016 est.) ++ $29.48 billion (2015 est.) ++ $28.44 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"2.2% (2016 est.) ++ 3.7% (2015 est.) ++ 3.5% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$14,500 (2016 est.) ++ $14,200 (2015 est.) ++ $13,700 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"68%","gdp_consumption":"16.8%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"17.6%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"12.8%","gdp_exports":"50%","gdp_imports":"-65.2% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"11.2%","gdp_sector_industry":"26.3%","gdp_sector_services":"62.5% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"grapes, tobacco, vegetables, fruits;
