No formal territorial claims were made until 1770, when Capt. James COOK took possession of the east coast in the name of Great Britain (all of Australia was claimed as British territory in 1829 with the creation of the colony of Western Australia). Six colonies were created in the late 18th and 19th centuries; they federated and became the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901. The new country took advantage of its natural resources to rapidly develop agricultural and manufacturing industries and to make a major contribution to the Allied effort in World Wars I and II. ++ In recent decades, Australia has become an internationally competitive, advanced market economy due in large part to economic reforms adopted in the 1980s and its location in one of the fastest growing regions of the world economy. Long-term concerns include an aging population, pressure on infrastructure, and environmental issues such as floods, droughts, and bushfires. Australia is the driest inhabited continent on earth, making it particularly vulnerable to the challenges of climate change. Australia is home to 10 per cent of the world's biodiversity, and a great number of its flora and fauna exist nowhere else in the world.","communications":{"country_id":"AU","fixed_phones_total":"3,609,900","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"42 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"13.471 million","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"155 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"highly developed and efficient","phone_system_international":"country code - 43; earth stations available in the Intelsat, Eutelsat satellite systems (2016)","phone_system_domestic":"fixed-line subscribership has been in decline since the mid-1990s with mobile-cellular subscribership eclipsing it by the late 1990s; the fiber-optic net is very extensive; all telephone applications and Internet services are available; broadband is avail","broadcast_media":"worldwide cable and satellite TV are available; the public incumbent ORF competes with three other major, several regional domestic, and up to 400 international TV stations; TV coverage is in principle 100%, but only 90% use broadcast media; Internet stre (2016)","internet_country_code":"at","internet_total_users":"7.273 million","internet_population_percent":"83.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:57","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:57"},"economy":{"country_id":"AU","overview":"Austria, with its well-developed market economy, skilled labor force, and high standard of living, is closely tied to other EU economies, especially Germany's. Its economy features a large service sector, a relatively sound industrial sector, and a small, but highly developed agricultural sector. ++  ++ Economic growth has been relatively weak in recent years, approaching 0.9% in 2015. Austria's 5.8% unemployment rate, while low by European standards, is at its highest rate since the end of World War II, driven by an increased number of refugees and EU migrants entering the labor market. Without extensive vocational training programs and generous early retirement, the unemployment rate would be even higher. ++  ++ Although Austria's fiscal position compares favorably with other euro-zone countries, it faces several external risks, such as unexpectedly weak world economic growth threatening the export market, Austrian banks' continued exposure to Central and Eastern Europe, repercussions from the Hypo Alpe Adria bank collapse, political and economic uncertainties caused by the European sovereign debt crisis, the current refugee crisis, and continued unrest in Russia\/Ukraine. Early signs point towards a slight improvement in 2016, driven by low interest rates on government debt. Currently, the budget deficit stands at 2.7% of GDP and public debt has reached a post-war high of 84.2% of the GDP.","gdp_power_parity":"$415.9 billion (2016 est.) ++ $410.4 billion (2015 est.) ++ $406.9 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"1.4% (2016 est.) ++ 0.9% (2015 est.) ++ 0.4% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$47,900 (2016 est.) ++ $47,600 (2015 est.) ++ $47,600 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"52.7%","gdp_consumption":"20%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"22.8%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"0.4%","gdp_exports":"53.1%","gdp_imports":"-49% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"1.3%","gdp_sector_industry":"28.1%","gdp_sector_services":"70.6% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"grains, potatoes, wine, fruit;
