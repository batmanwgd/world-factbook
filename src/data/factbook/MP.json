Mauritius has achieved steady growth over the last several decades, resulting in more equitable income distribution, increased life expectancy, lowered infant mortality, and a much-improved infrastructure. ++  ++ The economy currently rests on sugar, tourism, textiles and apparel, and financial services, but is expanding into fish processing, information and communications technology, and hospitality and property development. Sugarcane is grown on about 90% of the cultivated land area and accounts for 15% of export earnings. The government's development strategy centers on creating vertical and horizontal clusters of development in these sectors. Mauritius has attracted more than 32,000 offshore entities, many aimed at commerce in India, South Africa, and China. Investment in the banking sector alone has reached over $1 billion. Mauritiusâ€™ textile sector has taken advantage of the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, a preferential trade program that allows duty free access to the US market, with Mauritian exports to the US growing by 40% from 2000 to 2014. ++  ++ Mauritius' sound economic policies and prudent banking practices helped to mitigate negative effects of the global financial crisis in 2008-09. GDP grew in the 3-4% per year range in 2010-14, and the country continues to expand its trade and investment outreach around the globe. Growth in the US and Europe fostered goods and services exports, including tourism, while lower oil prices kept inflation low in 2015.","gdp_power_parity":"$25.85 billion (2016 est.) ++ $24.97 billion (2015 est.) ++ $24.12 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"3.5% (2016 est.) ++ 3.5% (2015 est.) ++ 3.6% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$20,500 (2016 est.) ++ $19,800 (2015 est.) ++ $19,200 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"74%","gdp_consumption":"14.4%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"17.3%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"3.4%","gdp_exports":"50.7%","gdp_imports":"-59.8% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"4%","gdp_sector_industry":"22.1%","gdp_sector_services":"73.9% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"sugarcane, tea, corn, potatoes, bananas, pulses;
