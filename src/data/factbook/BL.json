Gas accounts for roughly 50% of Bolivia's total exports and will fund more than half of its 2015 budget. However, the country remains one of the least developed countries in Latin America because of state-oriented policies that deter investment and growth. ++  ++ Following a disastrous economic crisis during the early 1980s, reforms spurred private investment, stimulated economic growth, and cut poverty rates in the 1990s. The period 2003-05 was characterized by political instability, racial tensions, and violent protests against plans - subsequently abandoned - to export Bolivia's newly discovered natural gas reserves to large Northern Hemisphere markets. In 2005, the government passed a controversial hydrocarbons law that imposed significantly higher royalties and required foreign firms then operating under risk-sharing contracts to surrender all production to the state energy company in exchange for a predetermined service fee. The global recession slowed growth, but Bolivia recorded the highest growth rate in South America during 2009 and has averaged 5.3% growth each year since 2009. High commodity prices between 2010 and 2013 sustained rapid growth and large trade surpluses. The global decline in oil prices in late 2014 exerted downward pressure on the price Bolivia receives for exported gas and resulted in lower GDP growth rates and losses in government revenue in 2015. ++  ++ A lack of foreign investment in the key sectors of mining and hydrocarbons, along with conflict among social groups, pose challenges for the Bolivian economy. In 2015, President Evo MORALES expanded efforts to court international investment and boost Bolivia’s energy production capacity. MORALES passed an investment law and promised not to nationalize additional industries in an effort to improve the investment climate.","gdp_power_parity":"$78.35 billion (2016 est.) ++ $75.56 billion (2015 est.) ++ $72.06 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"3.7% (2016 est.) ++ 4.8% (2015 est.) ++ 5.5% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$7,200 (2016 est.) ++ $7,000 (2015 est.) ++ $6,800 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"69.3%","gdp_consumption":"18.2%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"20.4%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"-1.4%","gdp_exports":"29%","gdp_imports":"-35.5% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"13.3%","gdp_sector_industry":"37.4%","gdp_sector_services":"53.6% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"soybeans, quinoa, Brazil nuts, sugarcane, coffee, corn, rice, potatoes, chia, coca","industries":"mining, smelting, petroleum, food and beverages, tobacco, handicrafts, clothing, jewelry","industrial_growth_rate":"3.5% (2016 est.)","labor_force":"4.993 million (2016 est.)","labor_force_notes":"","labor_force_services":"47.9% (2009 est.)","labor_force_industry":"20%","labor_force_agriculture":"32%","labor_force_occupation_notes":"","unemployment_rate":"7.5% (2016 est.) ++ 7.4% (2015 est.)","population_below_poverty":"45%","household_income_lowest_10":"0.8%","household_income_highest_10":"33.6% (2012 est.)","budget_revenues":"","taxes_revenues":"43.3% of GDP (2016 est.)","budget_net":"-6.2% of GDP (2016 est.)","public_debt":"47% of GDP (2016 est.) ++ 38.5% of GDP (2015 est.)","external_debt":"$11.83 billion (31 December 2016 est.) ++ $9.035 billion (31 December 2015 est.)","fiscal_year":"calendar year","inflation_rate":"3.9% (2016 est.) ++ 4.1% (2015 est.)","central_bank_discount_rate":"4.5% (31 December 2013) ++ 4% (31 december 2012)","commercial_bank_prime_lending_rate":"7.6% (31 December 2016 est.) ++ 8.07% (31 December 2015 est.)","stock_money_narrow":"$9.572 billion (31 December 2016 est.) ++ $8.946 billion (31 December 2015 est.)","stock_money_broad":"$17.77 billion (31 December 2016 est.) ++ $15.45 billion (31 December 2015 est.)","stock_domestic_credit":"$22.68 billion (31 December 2016 est.) ++ $18.9 billion (31 December 2015 est.)","exports":"$7.528 billion (2016 est.) ++ $8.197 billion (2015 est.)","exports_commodities":"natural gas, mineral ores, gold, soybeans and soy products, tin","exports_partners":"Brazil 28.1%, Argentina 16.9%, US 12.1%, Colombia 6.3%, China 5.3%, Japan 4.7%, South Korea 4.3% (2015)","imports":"$8.981 billion (2016 est.) ++ $9.069 billion (2015 est.)","imports_commodities":"machinery, petroleum products, vehicles, iron and steel, plastics","imports_partners":"China 17.9%, Brazil 16.5%, Argentina 11.8%, US 10.6%, Peru 6.2%, Japan 5.2%, Chile 4.6% (2015)","exchange_rates":"bolivianos (BOB) per US dollar - ++ 6.91 (2016 est.) ++ 6.91 (2015 est.) ++ 6.91 (2014 est.) ++ 6.91 (2013 est.) ++ 6.94 (2012 est.)","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:57","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:57"},"energy":{"country_id":"BL","electricity_production":"8.4 billion kWh (2014 est.)","electricity_consumption":"7.5 billion kWh (2014 est.)","electricity_exports":"0 kWh (2013 est.)","electricity_imports":"0 kWh (2013 est.)","electricity_generating_capacity":"2.2 million kW (2014 est.)","electricity_fossil_fuels":"68.8% of total installed capacity (2012 est.)","electricity_nuclear":"0% of total installed capacity (2012 est.)","electricity_hydroelectric":"30% of total installed capacity (2012 est.)","electricity_renewable":"1.3% of total installed capacity (2012 est.)","crude_oil_production":"55,610 bbl\/day (2015 est.)","crude_oil_exports":"0 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","crude_oil_imports":"0 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","crude_oil_reserves":"209.8 million bbl (1 January 2016 es)","petrol_production":"54,210 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","petrol_consumption":"78,000 bbl\/day (2014 est.)","petrol_exports":"7,292 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","petrol_imports":"19,940 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","natural_gas_production":"21.4 billion cu m (2014 est.)","natural_gas_consumption":"3.536 billion cu m (2014 est.)","natural_gas_exports":"17.86 billion cu m (2014 est.)","natural_gas_imports":"0 cu m (2013 est.)","natural_gas_reserves":"295.9 billion cu m (1 January 2016 es)","co2_output":"16 million Mt (2013 est.)","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:57","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:57"},"geography":{"country_id":"BL","location_description":"Central South America, southwest of Brazil","latitude":null,"longitude":null,"mapReferences":"South America","area_sqkm_total":1,"area_sqkm_land":1,"area_sqkm_water":15,"area_km_coastline":0,"area_note":"slightly less than three times the size of Montana","climate":"varies with altitude;
