{"id":"CR","iso_a3":"CRI","fips":"CS","continent":"NA","name":"Costa Rica","introduction":"Although explored by the Spanish early in the 16th century, initial attempts at colonizing Costa Rica proved unsuccessful due to a combination of factors, including disease from mosquito-infested swamps, brutal heat, resistance by natives, and pirate raids. It was not until 1563 that a permanent settlement of Cartago was established in the cooler, fertile central highlands. The area remained a colony for some two and a half centuries. In 1821, Costa Rica became one of several Central American provinces that jointly declared their independence from Spain. Two years later it joined the United Provinces of Central America, but this federation disintegrated in 1838, at which time Costa Rica proclaimed its sovereignty and independence. Since the late 19th century, only two brief periods of violence have marred the country's democratic development. In 1949, Costa Rica dissolved its armed forces. Although it still maintains a large agricultural sector, Costa Rica has expanded its economy to include strong technology and tourism industries. The standard of living is relatively high. Land ownership is widespread.","communications":{"country_id":"CR","fixed_phones_total":"","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"","mobile_phones_total":"","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"","phone_system_general_assessment":"","phone_system_international":"","phone_system_domestic":"","broadcast_media":"","internet_country_code":"","internet_total_users":"","internet_population_percent":"0.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58"},"economy":{"country_id":"CR","overview":"no economic activity","gdp_power_parity":"","gdp_real_growth":"","gdp_per_capita":"","gdp_household_consumption":"","gdp_consumption":"","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"","gdp_exports":"","gdp_imports":"","gdp_sector_agriculture":"","gdp_sector_industry":"","gdp_sector_services":"","agriculture_products":"","industries":"","industrial_growth_rate":"","labor_force":"","labor_force_notes":"","labor_force_services":"","labor_force_industry":"","labor_force_agriculture":"","labor_force_occupation_notes":"","unemployment_rate":"","population_below_poverty":"","household_income_lowest_10":"","household_income_highest_10":"","budget_revenues":"","taxes_revenues":"","budget_net":"","public_debt":"","external_debt":"","fiscal_year":"","inflation_rate":"","central_bank_discount_rate":"","commercial_bank_prime_lending_rate":"","stock_money_narrow":"","stock_money_broad":"","stock_domestic_credit":"","exports":"","exports_commodities":"","exports_partners":"","imports":"","imports_commodities":"","imports_partners":"","exchange_rates":"","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58"},"energy":{"country_id":"CR","electricity_production":"10 billion kWh (2014 est.)","electricity_consumption":"9.2 billion kWh (2014 est.)","electricity_exports":"600 million kWh (2014 est.)","electricity_imports":"800 million kWh (2014 est.)","electricity_generating_capacity":"2.9 million kW (2014 est.)","electricity_fossil_fuels":"30.7% of total installed capacity (2012 est.)","electricity_nuclear":"0% of total installed capacity (2012 est.)","electricity_hydroelectric":"55.9% of total installed capacity (2012 est.)","electricity_renewable":"13.3% of total installed capacity (2012 est.)","crude_oil_production":"0 bbl\/day (2015 est.)","crude_oil_exports":"1,300 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","crude_oil_imports":"0 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","crude_oil_reserves":"0 bbl (1 January 2016 es)","petrol_production":"0 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","petrol_consumption":"53,000 bbl\/day (2014 est.)","petrol_exports":"0 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","petrol_imports":"51,300 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","natural_gas_production":"0 cu m (2013 est.)","natural_gas_consumption":"0 cu m (2013 est.)","natural_gas_exports":"0 cu m (2013 est.)","natural_gas_imports":"0 cu m (2013 est.)","natural_gas_reserves":"0 cu m (1 January 2014 es)","co2_output":"7.2 million Mt (2013 est.)","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58"},"geography":{"country_id":"CR","location_description":"Oceania, islands in the Coral Sea, northeast of Australia","latitude":"9.7489170","longitude":"-83.7534280","mapReferences":"Oceania","area_sqkm_total":0,"area_sqkm_land":0,"area_sqkm_water":0,"area_km_coastline":3,"area_note":"about four times the size of the National Mall in Washington, DC","climate":"tropical","terrain":"sand and coral reefs and islands (cays)","hazards":"occasional tropical cyclones","notes":"important nesting area for birds and turtles","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58"},"government":{"country_id":"CR","name":"Coral Sea Islands Territory","name_etymology":"self-descriptive name to reflect the islands' position in the Coral Sea off the northeastern coast of Australia","conventional_long_form":"Coral Sea Islands Territory","conventional_short_form":"Coral Sea Islands","dependency_status":"territory of Australia;
