Growth has been led by the tourist sector, which employs about 30% of the labor force and provides more than 70% of hard currency earnings, and by tuna fishing. ++  ++ In recent years, the government has encouraged foreign investment to upgrade hotels and other services. At the same time, the government has moved to reduce the dependence on tourism by promoting the development of farming, fishing, and small-scale manufacturing. ++  ++ In 2008, having depleted its foreign exchange reserves, Seychelles defaulted on interest payments due on a $230 million Eurobond, requested assistance from the IMF, and immediately enacted a number of significant structural reforms, including liberalization of the exchange rate, reform of the public sector to include layoffs, and the sale of some state assets. In December 2013, the IMF declared that Seychelles had successfully transitioned to a market-based economy with full employment and a fiscal surplus. Seychelles grew at 4.3% in 2015 because of a strong tourist sector and expanding private sector credits; its fiscal surplus reached 4% of GDP.","gdp_power_parity":"$2.608 billion (2016 est.) ++ $2.487 billion (2015 est.) ++ $2.352 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"4.9% (2016 est.) ++ 5.7% (2015 est.) ++ 6.2% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$28,000 (2016 est.) ++ $27,000 (2015 est.) ++ $25,800 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"53.9%","gdp_consumption":"25.2%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"39.5%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"0%","gdp_exports":"63.4%","gdp_imports":"-82% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"2.6%","gdp_sector_industry":"13.9%","gdp_sector_services":"83.5% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"coconuts, cinnamon, vanilla, sweet potatoes, cassava (manioc, tapioca), copra, bananas;
