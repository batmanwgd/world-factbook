{"id":"MA","iso_a3":"MAR","fips":"MO","continent":"AF","name":"Morocco","introduction":"In 788, about a century after the Arab conquest of North Africa, a series of Moroccan Muslim dynasties began to rule in Morocco. In the 16th century, the Sa'adi monarchy, particularly under Ahmad al-MANSUR (1578-1603), repelled foreign invaders and inaugurated a golden age. The Alaouite Dynasty, to which the current Moroccan royal family belongs, dates from the 17th century. In 1860, Spain occupied northern Morocco and ushered in a half century of trade rivalry among European powers that saw Morocco's sovereignty steadily erode; in 1912, the French imposed a protectorate over the country. A protracted independence struggle with France ended successfully in 1956. The internationalized city of Tangier and most Spanish possessions were turned over to the new country that same year. Sultan MOHAMMED V, the current monarch's grandfather, organized the new state as a constitutional monarchy and in 1957 assumed the title of king. Since Spain's 1976 withdrawal from what is today called Western Sahara, Morocco has extended its de facto administrative control to roughly 80% of this territory; however, the UN does not recognize Morocco as the administering power for Western Sahara. The UN since 1991 has monitored a cease-fire between Morocco and the Polisario Front - Western Sahara's liberation movement - and leads ongoing negotiations over the status of the territory. ++ King MOHAMMED VI in early 2011 responded to the spread of pro-democracy protests in the region by implementing a reform program that included a new constitution, passed by popular referendum in July 2011, under which some new powers were extended to parliament and the prime minister but ultimate authority remains in the hands of the monarch. In November 2011, the Justice and Development Party (PJD) - a moderate Islamist party - won the largest number of seats in parliamentary elections, becoming the first Islamist party to lead the Moroccan Government. In September 2015, Morocco held its first ever direct elections for regional councils, one of the reforms included in the 2011 constitution. The PJD again won the largest number of seats in nationwide parliamentary elections in October 2016.","communications":{"country_id":"MA","fixed_phones_total":"253,000","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"1 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"11.152 million","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"47 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"system is above average for the region; competition among the three mobile service providers has spurred recent growth in the mobile market","phone_system_international":"country code - 261; landing point for the EASSy, SEACOM, and LION fiber-optic submarine cable systems; satellite earth stations - 2 (1 Intelsat - Indian Ocean, 1 Intersputnik - Atlantic Ocean region) (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"combined fixed-line and mobile-cellular teledensity about 45 per 100 persons","broadcast_media":"state-owned Radio Nationale Malagasy (RNM) and Television Malagasy (TVM) have an extensive national network reach; privately owned radio and TV broadcasters in cities and major towns; state-run radio dominates in rural areas; relays of 2 international bro (2007)","internet_country_code":"mg","internet_total_users":"994,000","internet_population_percent":"4.2","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:59","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:59"},"economy":{"country_id":"MA","overview":"Agriculture, including fishing and forestry, is a mainstay of the economy, accounting for more than one-fourth of GDP and employing roughly 80% of the population. Deforestation and erosion, aggravated by the use of firewood as the primary source of fuel, are serious concerns. ++  ++ After discarding socialist economic policies in the mid-1990s, Madagascar followed a World Bank- and IMF-led policy of privatization and liberalization until the onset of a political crisis, which lasted from 2009 to 2013. The free market strategy had placed the country on a slow and steady growth path from an extremely low starting point. Exports of apparel boomed after gaining duty-free access to the US in 2000; however, Madagascar's failure to comply with the requirements of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) led to the termination of the country's duty-free access in January 2010, a sharp fall in textile production, and a loss of more than 100,000 jobs. ++  ++ Madagascar regained AGOA access in January 2015 following the democratic election of a new president the previous year. In November 2015, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a Rapid Credit Facility to Madagascar worth about $42.1 million to help the government meet its balance of payments needs. The IMF also approved a staff monitoring program to guide policy implementation and indicated that Madagascar must demonstrate the capability to sustain reforms to qualify for future requests for a credit facility.","gdp_power_parity":"$37.49 billion (2016 est.) ++ $36 billion (2015 est.) ++ $34.91 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"4.1% (2016 est.) ++ 3.1% (2015 est.) ++ 3.3% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$1,500 (2016 est.) ++ $1,500 (2015 est.) ++ $1,500 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"82.8%","gdp_consumption":"12.9%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"15.8%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"0%","gdp_exports":"31.3%","gdp_imports":"-42.8% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"24.8%","gdp_sector_industry":"16.3%","gdp_sector_services":"58.9% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"coffee, vanilla, sugarcane, cloves, cocoa, rice, cassava (manioc, tapioca), beans, bananas, peanuts;
