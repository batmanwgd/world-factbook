Oil has supplanted forestry as the mainstay of the economy, providing a major share of government revenues and exports. Natural gas is increasingly being converted to electricity rather than being flared, greatly improving energy prospects. New mining projects, particularly iron ore, which entered production in late 2013, may add as much as $1 billion to annual government revenue. ++  ++ Economic reform efforts have been undertaken with the support of international organizations, notably the World Bank and the IMF, including the recently concluded Article IV consultations. The current administration faces difficult economic challenges of stimulating recovery and reducing poverty. The recent drop in oil prices has constrained government spending; lower oil prices forced the government to cut more than $1 billion in planned spending. However, the government increased infrastructure spending for the September 2015 All-Africa Games and also ahead of the March 2016 presidential election, putting further pressure on the budget. ++  ++ Officially the country became a net external creditor as of 2011, with external debt representing only about 16% of GDP and debt servicing less than 3% of government revenue.","gdp_power_parity":"$30.27 billion (2016 est.) ++ $29.75 billion (2015 est.) ++ $29.08 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"1.7% (2016 est.) ++ 2.3% (2015 est.) ++ 6.8% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$6,800 (2016 est.) ++ $6,800 (2015 est.) ++ $6,800 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"50%","gdp_consumption":"10.5%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"48.7%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"0.2%","gdp_exports":"44.5%","gdp_imports":"-53.9% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"4.9%","gdp_sector_industry":"69.8%","gdp_sector_services":"25.3% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"cassava (manioc, tapioca), sugar, rice, corn, peanuts, vegetables, coffee, cocoa;
