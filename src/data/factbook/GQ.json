Total federal spending (defense and non-defense) amounted to $1.973 billion in 2014, or 40.4% of GDP. Service exports, mainly spending by foreign tourists while on Guam, amounted to $651 million in 2013, or 13.3% of GDP. In 2013, Guam’s economy grew 0.6%. Despite slow growth, Guam’s economy has been stable over the last decade. National defense spending cushions the island’s economy against fluctuations in tourism. Guam serves as a forward US base for the Western Pacific and is home to thousands of American military personnel. Federal grants amounted to $373.3 million in 2013, or 32.6% of Guam’s total revenues for the fiscal year.","gdp_power_parity":"$4.882 billion (2013 est.) ++ $4.756 billion (2012 est.) ++ $4.562 billion (2011 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"0.6% (2013 est.) ++ 1.8% (2012) ++ -0.3% (2011)","gdp_per_capita":"$30,500 (2013 est.) ++ $29,800 (2012 est.) ++ $28,600 (2011 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"63.7%","gdp_consumption":"64.9%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"NA","gdp_exports":"17%","gdp_imports":"-51.2% (2013)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"NA%","gdp_sector_industry":"NA%","gdp_sector_services":"NA%","agriculture_products":"fruits, copra, vegetables;
