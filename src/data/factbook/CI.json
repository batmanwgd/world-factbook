Exports of goods and services account for approximately one-third of GDP, with commodities making up some 60% of total exports. Copper alone provides 20% of government revenue. ++  ++ From 2003 through 2013, real growth averaged almost 5% per year, despite the slight contraction in 2009 that resulted from the global financial crisis. Growth slowed to an estimated 2.3% in 2015. A continued drop in copper prices prompted Chile to experience its second consecutive year of slow growth, elevated inflation, and a depreciating currency. ++  ++ Chile deepened its longstanding commitment to trade liberalization with the signing of a free trade agreement with the US, which took effect on 1 January 2004. Chile has 22 trade agreements covering 60 countries including agreements with the EU, Mercosur, China, India, South Korea, and Mexico. In May 2010, Chile signed the OECD Convention, becoming the first South American country to join the OECD. In October 2015, Chile joined the US and 10 other countries and concluded negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement. The agreement will need to be ratified by the Chilean legislature. ++  ++ The Chilean Government has generally followed a countercyclical fiscal policy, accumulating surpluses in sovereign wealth funds during periods of high copper prices and economic growth, and generally allowing deficit spending only during periods of low copper prices and growth. As of 31 October 2015, those sovereign wealth funds - kept mostly outside the country and separate from Central Bank reserves - amounted to more than $22.4 billion. Chile used these funds to finance fiscal stimulus packages during the 2009 economic downturn. ++  ++ In 2014, President Michelle BACHELET introduced tax reforms aimed at delivering her campaign promise to fight inequality and to provide access to education and health care. The reforms are expected to generate additional tax revenues equal to 3% of Chileâ€™s GDP, mostly by increasing corporate tax rates to OECD averages.","gdp_power_parity":"$436.1 billion (2016 est.) ++ $428.8 billion (2015 est.) ++ $419.2 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"1.7% (2016 est.) ++ 2.3% (2015 est.) ++ 1.8% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$24,000 (2016 est.) ++ $23,800 (2015 est.) ++ $23,500 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"64.9%","gdp_consumption":"14.1%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"22%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"-0.2%","gdp_exports":"27.7%","gdp_imports":"-28.5% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"4%","gdp_sector_industry":"32.4%","gdp_sector_services":"63.6% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"grapes, apples, pears, onions, wheat, corn, oats, peaches, garlic, asparagus, beans;
