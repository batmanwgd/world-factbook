The French assumed control in 1715, developing the island into an important naval base overseeing Indian Ocean trade, and establishing a plantation economy of sugar cane. The British captured the island in 1810, during the Napoleonic Wars. Mauritius remained a strategically important British naval base, and later an air station, playing an important role during World War II for anti-submarine and convoy operations, as well as the collection of signals intelligence. Independence from the UK was attained in 1968. A stable democracy with regular free elections and a positive human rights record, the country has attracted considerable foreign investment and has one of Africa's highest per capita incomes.","communications":{"country_id":"MU","fixed_phones_total":"434,932","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"13 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"6.647 million","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"202 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"modern system consisting of open-wire, microwave, and radiotelephone communication stations; limited coaxial cable; domestic satellite system with 8 earth stations","phone_system_international":"country code - 968; the Fiber-Optic Link Around the Globe (FLAG) and the SEA-ME-WE-3 submarine cable provide connectivity to Asia, the Middle East, and Europe; satellite earth stations - 2 Intelsat (Indian Ocean), 1 Arabsat (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"fixed-line and mobile-cellular subscribership both increasing with fixed-line phone service gradually being introduced to remote villages using wireless local loop systems","broadcast_media":"1 state-run TV broadcaster; TV stations transmitting from Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Yemen available via satellite TV; state-run radio operates multiple stations; first private radio station began operating in 2007 and 2 additional stations now operating (2007)","internet_country_code":"om","internet_total_users":"2.438 million","internet_population_percent":"74.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:00","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:00"},"economy":{"country_id":"MU","overview":"Oman is heavily dependent on its dwindling oil resources, which generate 84% of government revenue. In 2015, low global oil prices drove Omanâ€™s budget deficit to $6.5 billion, or nearly 11% of GDP. Oman has limited foreign assets and is issuing debt to cover its deficit. ++  ++ Oman is using enhanced oil recovery techniques to boost production and has actively pursued a development plan that focuses on diversification, industrialization, and privatization, with the objective of reducing the oil sector's contribution to GDP from 46% at present to 9% by 2020. Tourism and gas-based industries are key components of the government's diversification strategy. ++  ++ Muscat also is focused on creating more jobs to employ the rising number of Omanis entering the workforce. Increases in social welfare benefits, however, particularly since the Arab Spring, dating to 2011, have challenged the government's ability to effectively balance its budget, as oil prices decline. Omani officials intend to reduce social entitlements to cut the deficit but have faced stiff public opposition to spending cuts, hindering their implementation.","gdp_power_parity":"$173.1 billion (2016 est.) ++ $170 billion (2015 est.) ++ $164.6 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"1.8% (2016 est.) ++ 3.3% (2015 est.) ++ 2.9% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$43,700 (2016 est.) ++ $44,300 (2015 est.) ++ $44,300 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"41%","gdp_consumption":"28.4%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"37%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"-4.7%","gdp_exports":"49.4%","gdp_imports":"-51.1% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"1.7%","gdp_sector_industry":"45.4%","gdp_sector_services":"52.9% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"dates, limes, bananas, alfalfa, vegetables;
