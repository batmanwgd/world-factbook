It plays an influential global role as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, NATO, the G-8, the G-20, the EU, and other multilateral organizations. France rejoined NATO's integrated military command structure in 2009, reversing DE GAULLE's 1966 decision to withdraw French forces from NATO. Since 1958, it has constructed a hybrid presidential-parliamentary governing system resistant to the instabilities experienced in earlier, more purely parliamentary administrations. In recent decades, its reconciliation and cooperation with Germany have proved central to the economic integration of Europe, including the introduction of a common currency, the euro, in January 1999. In the early 21st century, five French overseas entities - French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mayotte, and Reunion - became French regions and were made part of France proper.","communications":{"country_id":"FR","fixed_phones_total":"38.929 million","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"58 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"66.681 million","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"100 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"highly developed","phone_system_international":"country code - 33; numerous submarine cables provide links throughout Europe, Asia, Australia, the Middle East, and US; satellite earth stations - more than 3 (2 Intelsat (with total of 5 antennas - 2 for Indian Ocean and 3 for Atlantic Ocean), NA Eutelsa","phone_system_domestic":"extensive cable and microwave radio relay; extensive use of fiber-optic cable; domestic satellite system","broadcast_media":"a mix of both publicly operated and privately owned TV stations; state-owned France television stations operate 4 networks, one of which is a network of regional stations, and has part-interest in several thematic cable\/satellite channels and internationa (2008)","internet_country_code":"me","internet_total_users":"56.367 million","internet_population_percent":"84.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58"},"economy":{"country_id":"FR","overview":"The French economy is diversified across all sectors. The government has partially or fully privatized many large companies, including Air France, France Telecom, Renault, and Thales. However, the government maintains a strong presence in some sectors, particularly power, public transport, and defense industries. With more than 84 million foreign tourists per year, France is the most visited country in the world and maintains the third largest income in the world from tourism. France's leaders remain committed to a capitalism in which they maintain social equity by means of laws, tax policies, and social spending that mitigate economic inequality. ++  ++ France's real GDP increased by 1.1% in 2015. The unemployment rate (including overseas territories) increased from 7.8% in 2008 to 9.9% in the fourth quarter of 2014. Youth unemployment in metropolitan France decreased from a high of 25.4% in the fourth quarter of 2012 to 24.3% in the fourth quarter of 2014. ++  ++ Lower-than-expected growth and high spending have strained France's public finances. The budget deficit rose sharply from 3.3% of GDP in 2008 to 7.5% of GDP in 2009 before improving to 4% of GDP in 2014 and 2015, while France's public debt rose from 68% of GDP to more than 98% in 2015, and may hit 100% in 2016. ++  ++ Elected on a conventionally leftist platform, President Francois HOLLANDE surprised and angered many supporters with a January 2014 speech announcing a sharp change in his economic policy, recasting himself as a liberalizing reformer. The government's budget for 2014 shifted the balance of fiscal consolidation from taxes to a total of $24 billion in spending cuts. In December 2014, HOLLANDE announced additional reforms, including a plan to extend commercial business hours, liberalize professional services, and sell off $6.2-12.4 billion in state owned assets. Franceâ€™s tax burden remains well above the EU average and income tax cuts over the past decade are being partly reversed, particularly for higher earners. The top rate of income tax is 41%. The government is allowing a 75% payroll tax on salaries over $1.24 million to lapse.","gdp_power_parity":"$2.737 trillion (2016 est.) ++ $2.701 trillion (2015 est.) ++ $2.667 trillion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"1.3% (2016 est.) ++ 1.3% (2015 est.) ++ 0.6% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$42,400 (2016 est.) ++ $42,000 (2015 est.) ++ $41,700 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"54.8%","gdp_consumption":"23.8%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"21.8%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"0.7%","gdp_exports":"29.9%","gdp_imports":"-31% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"1.7%","gdp_sector_industry":"19.4%","gdp_sector_services":"78.8% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"wheat, cereals, sugar beets, potatoes, wine grapes;
