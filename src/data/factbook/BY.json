It has retained closer political and economic ties to Russia than have any of the other former Soviet republics. Belarus and Russia signed a treaty on a two-state union on 8 December 1999 envisioning greater political and economic integration. Although Belarus agreed to a framework to carry out the accord, serious implementation has yet to take place. Since his election in July 1994 as the country's first and only directly elected president, Aleksandr LUKASHENKO has steadily consolidated his power through authoritarian means and a centralized economic system. Government restrictions on political and civil freedoms, freedom of speech and the press, peaceful assembly, and religion have remained in place. The situation was somewhat aggravated after security services cracked down on mass protests challenging election results in the capital, Minsk, following the 2010 presidential election, but little protest occurred after the 2015 election.","communications":{"country_id":"BY","fixed_phones_total":"21,774","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"less than 1 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"4.998 million","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"47 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"sparse system of open-wire, radiotelephone communications, and low-capacity microwave radio relays","phone_system_international":"country code - 257; satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat (Indian Ocean) (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"telephone density one of the lowest in the world; fixed-line connections stand at well less than 1 per 100 persons; mobile-cellular usage has increased to roughly 45 per 100 persons","broadcast_media":"state-controlled La Radiodiffusion et Television Nationale de Burundi (RTNB) operates the lone TV station and the only national radio network; about 10 privately owned radio stations; transmissions of several international broadcasters are available in Bu (2007)","internet_country_code":"bi","internet_total_users":"523,000","internet_population_percent":"4.9","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58"},"economy":{"country_id":"BY","overview":"Burundi is a landlocked, resource-poor country with an underdeveloped manufacturing sector. Agriculture accounts for over 40% of GDP and employs more than 90% of the population. Burundi's primary exports are coffee and tea, which account for 90% of foreign exchange earnings. Thus, Burundi's export earnings - and its ability to pay for imports - rest primarily on weather conditions and international coffee and tea prices, although exports are a relatively small share of GDP. Burundi is heavily dependent on aid from bilateral and multilateral donors. Foreign aid in 2014 represented 42% of Burundi's national income, the second highest rate in Sub-Saharan Africa. Burundi joined the East African Community (EAC) in 2009. ++  ++ An ethnic war that ended in 2005 resulted in more than 200,000 deaths, forced more than 48,000 refugees into Tanzania, and displaced 140,000 others internally. Political stability, aid flows, and economic activity improved following the end of the civil war, but underlying weaknesses - a high poverty rate, poor education rates, a weak legal system, a poor transportation network, overburdened utilities, and low administrative capacity – have prevented the government from implementing planned economic reforms. Government corruption has also hindered the development of a private sector as companies have to deal with ever changing rules. The purchasing power of most Burundians has decreased as wage increases have not kept pace with inflation. ++  ++ In 2015, Burundi’s economy suffered from political turmoil over President NKURUNZIZA’s controversial third term. Blocked transportation routes disrupted the flow of agricultural goods. And donors withdrew aid, increasing Burundi’s budget deficit. When the unrest ends, regional infrastructure improvements driven by the EAC and funded by the World Bank may help improve Burundi’s transport connections and lower transportation costs.","gdp_power_parity":"$7.892 billion (2016 est.) ++ $7.933 billion (2015 est.) ++ $8.259 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"-0.5% (2016 est.) ++ -4% (2015 est.) ++ 4.5% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$800 (2016 est.) ++ $800 (2015 est.) ++ $900 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"92.4%","gdp_consumption":"16.5%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"24.3%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"-8.1%","gdp_exports":"7.5%","gdp_imports":"-32.6% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"45.8%","gdp_sector_industry":"17.1%","gdp_sector_services":"37.1% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"coffee, cotton, tea, corn, sorghum, sweet potatoes, bananas, cassava (manioc, tapioca);
