{"id":"CV","iso_a3":"CPV","fips":"CV","continent":"AF","name":"Cape Verde","introduction":"The uninhabited islands were discovered and colonized by the Portuguese in the 15th century; Cabo Verde subsequently became a trading center for African slaves and later an important coaling and resupply stop for whaling and transatlantic shipping. The fusing of European and various African cultural traditions is reflected in Cabo Verde’s Crioulo language, music, and pano textiles. Following independence in 1975, and a tentative interest in unification with Guinea-Bissau, a one-party system was established and maintained until multi-party elections were held in 1990. Cabo Verde continues to exhibit one of Africa's most stable democratic governments. Repeated droughts during the second half of the 20th century caused significant hardship and prompted heavy emigration. As a result, Cabo Verde's expatriate population is greater than its domestic one. Most Cabo Verdeans have both African and Portuguese antecedents. Cabo Verde’s population descends from its first permanent inhabitants in the late 15th-century – a preponderance of West African slaves, a small share of Portuguese colonists, and even fewer Italians, Spaniards, and Portuguese Jews. The fusing of European and various African cultural traditions is reflected in Cabo Verde’s Crioulo language, music, and pano textiles. Among the nine inhabited islands, population distribution is variable. Islands in the east are very dry and are only sparsely settled to exploit their extensive salt deposits. The more southerly islands receive more precipitation and support larger populations, but agriculture and livestock grazing have damaged their soil fertility and vegetation. For centuries, the country’s overall population size has fluctuated significantly, as recurring periods of famine and epidemics have caused high death tolls and emigration.","communications":{"country_id":"CV","fixed_phones_total":"58,456","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"11 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"646,000","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"118 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"effective system, extensive modernization from 1996-2000 following partial privatization in 1995","phone_system_international":"country code - 238; landing point for the Atlantis-2 fiber-optic transatlantic telephone cable that provides links to South America, Senegal, and Europe; HF radiotelephone to Senegal and Guinea-Bissau; satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean) (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"major service provider is Cabo Verde Telecom; fiber-optic ring, completed in 2001, links all islands providing Internet access and ISDN services; cellular service introduced in 1998; broadband services launched in 2004","broadcast_media":"state-run TV and radio broadcast network plus a growing number of private broadcasters; Portuguese public TV and radio services for Africa are available; transmissions of a few international broadcasters are available (2007)","internet_country_code":"cv","internet_total_users":"235,000","internet_population_percent":"43.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58"},"economy":{"country_id":"CV","overview":"Cabo Verde’s economy is vulnerable to external shocks and depends on development aid, foreign investment, remittances, and tourism. The economy is service-oriented with commerce, transport, tourism, and public services accounting for about three-fourths of GDP. Tourism is the mainstay of the economy and depends on conditions in the euro-zone countries. Cabo Verde annually runs a high trade deficit financed by foreign aid and remittances from its large pool of emigrants; remittances as a share of GDP are one of the highest in Sub-Saharan Africa. ++  ++ Although about 40% of the population lives in rural areas, the share of food production in GDP is low. The island economy suffers from a poor natural resource base, including serious water shortages, exacerbated by cycles of long-term drought, and poor soil for growing food on several of the islands, requiring it to import most of what it consumes. The fishing potential, mostly lobster and tuna, is not fully exploited. ++  ++ Economic reforms are aimed at developing the private sector and attracting foreign investment to diversify the economy and mitigate high unemployment. The government’s elevated debt levels have limited its capacity to finance any shortfalls.","gdp_power_parity":"$3.583 billion (2016 est.) ++ $3.457 billion (2015 est.) ++ $3.408 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"3.6% (2016 est.) ++ 1.5% (2015 est.) ++ 1.9% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$6,700 (2016 est.) ++ $6,600 (2015 est.) ++ $6,600 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"53.5%","gdp_consumption":"15.2%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"33.2%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"0.8%","gdp_exports":"32.9%","gdp_imports":"-35.6% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"7.4%","gdp_sector_industry":"16.4%","gdp_sector_services":"76.2% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"bananas, corn, beans, sweet potatoes, sugarcane, coffee, peanuts;
