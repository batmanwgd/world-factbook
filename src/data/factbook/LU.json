It lost more than half of its territory to Belgium in 1839 but gained a larger measure of autonomy. Full independence was attained in 1867. Overrun by Germany in both world wars, it ended its neutrality in 1948 when it entered into the Benelux Customs Union and when it joined NATO the following year. In 1957, Luxembourg became one of the six founding countries of the EEC (later the EU), and in 1999 it joined the euro currency area.","communications":{"country_id":"LU","fixed_phones_total":"276,900","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"49 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"807,000","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"141 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"highly developed, completely automated and efficient system, mainly buried cables","phone_system_international":"country code - 352 (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"fixed-line teledensity about 50 per 100 persons; nationwide mobile-cellular telephone system with market for mobile-cellular phones virtually saturated","broadcast_media":"Luxembourg has a long tradition of operating radio and TV services for pan-European audiences and is home to Europe's largest privately owned broadcast media group, the RTL Group, which operates 46 TV stations and 29 radio stations in Europe; also home to (2008)","internet_country_code":"lu","internet_total_users":"555,000","internet_population_percent":"97.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:59","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:59"},"economy":{"country_id":"LU","overview":"This small, stable, high-income economy has historically featured solid growth, low inflation, and low unemployment. The industrial sector, initially dominated by steel, has become increasingly diversified to include chemicals, machinery and equipment, rubber, automotive components, and other products. The financial sector, which accounts for about 36% of GDP, is the leading sector in the economy. The economy depends on foreign and cross-border workers for about 39% of its labor force. ++  ++ Luxembourg experienced uneven economic growth in the aftermath of the global economic crisis that began in late 2008. Luxembourg's GDP contracted 3.6% in 2009, rebounded in 2010-12, fell again in 2013-14, but recovered in 2015. Unemployment has remained below the EU average despite having increased from a historically low rate of 4% in the 2000s to 7.1% in 2014. ++  ++ The country continues to enjoy an extraordinarily high standard of living - GDP per capita ranks among the highest in the world and is the highest in the euro zone. Luxembourg has one of the highest current account surpluses as a share of GDP in the euro zone, and it maintains a healthy budgetary position and the lowest public debt level in the region. ++  ++ Luxembourg has lost some of its advantage as a favorable tax location because of OECD and EU pressure. In 2015, the government’s compliance with EU requirements to implement automatic exchange of tax information on savings accounts - thus ending banking secrecy - has depressed banking activity and dampened GDP growth. Likewise, changes to the way EU members collect taxes from e-commerce has cut Luxembourg’s tax revenues, requiring the government to raise additional levies and to reduce some direct social benefits.","gdp_power_parity":"$58.74 billion (2016 est.) ++ $56.75 billion (2015 est.) ++ $54.13 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"3.5% (2016 est.) ++ 4.8% (2015 est.) ++ 4.1% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$102,000 (2016 est.) ++ $100,800 (2015 est.) ++ $98,400 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"27.9%","gdp_consumption":"16.4%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"17.5%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"0.2%","gdp_exports":"210.3%","gdp_imports":"-172.3% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"0.2%","gdp_sector_industry":"11.1%","gdp_sector_services":"88.7% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"grapes, barley, oats, potatoes, wheat, fruits;
