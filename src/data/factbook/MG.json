{"id":"MG","iso_a3":"MDG","fips":"MA","continent":"AF","name":"Madagascar","introduction":"Madagascar was one of the last major landmasses on earth to be colonized by humans. The earliest settlers from present-day Indonesia arrived between A.D. 350 and 550. The island attracted Arab and Persian traders as early as the 7th century, and migrants from Africa arrived around A.D. 1000. Madagascar was a pirate stronghold during the late 17th and early 18th centuries, and served as a slave trading center into the 19th century. From the 16th to the late 19th century, a native Merina Kingdom dominated much of Madagascar. The island was conquered by the French in 1896 who made it a colony; independence was regained in 1960. During 1992-93, free presidential and National Assembly elections were held ending 17 years of single-party rule. In 1997, in the second presidential race, Didier RATSIRAKA, the leader during the 1970s and 1980s, was returned to the presidency. The 2001 presidential election was contested between the followers of Didier RATSIRAKA and Marc RAVALOMANANA, nearly causing secession of half of the country. In April 2002, the High Constitutional Court announced RAVALOMANANA the winner. RAVALOMANANA won a second term in 2006 but, following protests in 2009, handed over power to the military, which then conferred the presidency on the mayor of Antananarivo, Andry RAJOELINA, in what amounted to a coup d'etat. Following a lengthy mediation process led by the Southern African Development Community, Madagascar held UN-supported presidential and parliamentary elections in 2013. Former de facto finance minister Hery RAJAONARIMAMPIANINA won a runoff election in December 2013 and was inaugurated in January 2014.","communications":{"country_id":"MG","fixed_phones_total":"255,634","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"9 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"3.068 million","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"103 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"network is improving with international direct dialing available in many areas; a fiber-optic network has been installed that is improving broadband and communication services between major urban centers with multiple companies providing inter-city fiber-","phone_system_international":"country code - 976; satellite earth stations - 7 (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"very low fixed-line teledensity; there are multiple mobile-cellular providers and subscribership is increasing","broadcast_media":"following a law passed in 2005, Mongolia's state-run radio and TV provider converted to a public service provider; also available are private radio and TV broadcasters, as well as multi-channel satellite and cable TV providers; more than 100 radio station (2008)","internet_country_code":"mn","internet_total_users":"642,000","internet_population_percent":"21.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:59","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:59"},"economy":{"country_id":"MG","overview":"Foreign direct investment in Mongolia's extractive industries â€“ which are based on extensive deposits of copper, gold, coal, molybdenum, fluorspar, uranium, tin, and tungsten - has transformed Mongolia's landlocked economy from its traditional dependence on herding and agriculture. Exports now account for more than half of GDP. Mongolia depends on China for more than 60% of its external trade - China receives some 90% of Mongolia's exports and supplies Mongolia with more than one-third of its imports. Mongolia also relies on Russia for 90% of its energy supplies, leaving it vulnerable to price increases. Remittances from Mongolians working abroad, particularly in South Korea, are significant. ++  ++ Soviet assistance, at its height one-third of GDP, disappeared almost overnight in 1990 and 1991 at the time of the dismantlement of the USSR. The following decade saw Mongolia endure both deep recession, because of political inaction, and natural disasters, as well as strong economic growth, because of market reforms and extensive privatization of the formerly state-run economy. The country opened a fledgling stock exchange in 1991. Mongolia joined the WTO in 1997 and seeks to expand its participation in regional economic and trade regimes. ++  ++ Growth averaged nearly 9% per year in 2004-08 largely because of high copper prices globally and new gold production. By late 2008, Mongolia was hit by the global financial crisis and Mongolia's real economy contracted 1.3% in 2009. In early 2009, the IMF reached a $236 million Stand-by Arrangement with Mongolia and it emerged from the crisis with a stronger banking sector and better fiscal management. In October 2009, Mongolia passed long-awaited legislation on an investment agreement to develop the Oyu Tolgoi (OT) mine, among the world's largest untapped copper-gold deposits. However, a dispute with foreign investors developing OT called into question the attractiveness of Mongolia as a destination for foreign investment. This caused a severe drop in FDI, and a slowing economy, leading to the dismissal of Prime Minister ALTANKHUYAG in November 2014. The economy had grown more than 10% per year between 2011 and 2013 - largely on the strength of commodity exports and high government spending - before slowing to 7.8% in 2014 and 2.3% in 2015. ++  ++ The current government has made restoring investor trust and reviving the economy its top priority, but has failed to invigorate the economy in the face of the large drop off in foreign direct investment. Mongolia's economy faces near-term economic risks from the government's loose fiscal and monetary policies, from uncertainties in foreign demand for Mongolian exports, and on Mongolia's ability to access financing. The May 2015 agreement with Rio Tinto to restart the OT mine and the subsequent $4.4 billion finance package signing in December 2015 have served to increase investor confidence but are unlikely to overcome the downward economic pressures in the short term.","gdp_power_parity":"$36.65 billion (2016 est.) ++ $36.64 billion (2015 est.) ++ $35.79 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"0% (2016 est.) ++ 2.4% (2015 est.) ++ 7.9% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$12,200 (2016 est.) ++ $12,300 (2015 est.) ++ $12,200 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"57.6%","gdp_consumption":"12.1%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"19.9%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"7.4%","gdp_exports":"40.1%","gdp_imports":"-37.1% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"14.6%","gdp_sector_industry":"35.1%","gdp_sector_services":"50.3% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"wheat, barley, vegetables, forage crops;
