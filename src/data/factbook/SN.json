{"id":"SN","iso_a3":"SEN","fips":"SG","continent":"AF","name":"Senegal","introduction":"The French colonies of Senegal and French Sudan were merged in 1959 and granted independence in 1960 as the Mali Federation. The union broke up after only a few months. Senegal joined with The Gambia to form the nominal confederation of Senegambia in 1982. The envisaged integration of the two countries was never implemented, and the union was dissolved in 1989. The Movement of Democratic Forces in the Casamance has led a low-level separatist insurgency in southern Senegal since the 1980s, and several peace deals have failed to resolve the conflict. Nevertheless, Senegal remains one of the most stable democracies in Africa and has a long history of participating in international peacekeeping and regional mediation. Senegal was ruled by a Socialist Party for 40 years until Abdoulaye WADE was elected president in 2000. He was reelected in 2007 and during his two terms amended Senegal's constitution over a dozen times to increase executive power and weaken the opposition. His decision to run for a third presidential term sparked a large public backlash that led to his defeat in a March 2012 runoff with Macky SALL, whose term runs until 2019. A 2016 constitutional referendum reduced the term to five years with a maximum of two consecutive terms for future presidents.","communications":{"country_id":"SN","fixed_phones_total":"2,021,500","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"36 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"8.211 million","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"145 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"excellent service","phone_system_international":"country code - 65; numerous submarine cables provide links throughout Asia, Australia, the Middle East, Europe, and US; satellite earth stations - 4; supplemented by VSAT coverage (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"excellent domestic facilities; combined fixed-line and mobile-cellular teledensity more than 180 telephones per 100 persons; multiple providers of high-speed Internet connectivity","broadcast_media":"state controls broadcast media; 8 domestic TV stations operated by MediaCorp which is wholly owned by a state investment company; broadcasts from Malaysian and Indonesian stations available; satellite dishes banned; multi-channel cable TV service availabl","internet_country_code":"sg","internet_total_users":"4.659 million","internet_population_percent":"82.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:01","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:01"},"economy":{"country_id":"SN","overview":"Singapore has a highly developed and successful free-market economy. It enjoys a remarkably open and corruption-free environment, stable prices, and a per capita GDP higher than that of most developed countries. Unemployment is very low. The economy depends heavily on exports, particularly of consumer electronics, information technology products, medical and optical devices, pharmaceuticals, and on its vibrant transportation, business, and financial services sectors. ++  ++ The economy contracted 0.6% in 2009 as a result of the global financial crisis, but has continued to grow since 2010 on the strength of renewed exports. Growth in 2014-15 was slower at under 3%, largely a result of soft demand for exports amid a sluggish global economy and weak growth in Singapore’s manufacturing sector. ++  ++ The government is attempting to restructure Singapore’s economy by weaning its dependence on foreign labor, addressing weak productivity, and increasing Singaporean wages. Singapore has attracted major investments in pharmaceuticals and medical technology production and will continue efforts to strengthen its position as Southeast Asia's leading financial and high-tech hub. Singapore is a member of the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade negotiations, as well as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership negotiations with the nine other ASEAN members plus Australia, China, India, Japan, South Korea, and New Zealand. In 2015, Singapore formed, with the other ASEAN members, the ASEAN Economic Community.","gdp_power_parity":"$486.9 billion (2016 est.) ++ $478.8 billion (2015 est.) ++ $469.4 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"1.7% (2016 est.) ++ 2% (2015 est.) ++ 3.3% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$87,100 (2016 est.) ++ $86,500 (2015 est.) ++ $85,800 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"36.1%","gdp_consumption":"10.8%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"23.4%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"2%","gdp_exports":"176.9%","gdp_imports":"-149.2% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"0%","gdp_sector_industry":"26.6%","gdp_sector_services":"73.4% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"orchids, vegetables;
