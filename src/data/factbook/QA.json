{"id":"QA","iso_a3":"QAT","fips":"QA","continent":"AS","name":"Qatar","introduction":"Ruled by the Al Thani family since the mid-1800s, Qatar within the last 60 years transformed itself from a poor British protectorate noted mainly for pearling into an independent state with significant oil and natural gas revenues. The continuous siphoning off of petroleum revenue through the mid-1990s by Qatari amirs permanently residing in Europe had stunted Qatar’s economic growth. Former amir HAMAD bin Khalifa Al Thani, who overthrew his father in a bloodless coup in 1995, ushered in wide-sweeping political and media reforms, unprecedented economic investment, and a growing Qatari regional leadership role, in part through the creation of the pan-Arab satellite news network Al-Jazeera and Qatar's mediation of some regional conflicts. In the 2000s, Qatar resolved its longstanding border disputes with both Bahrain and Saudi Arabia and by 2007 had attained the highest per capita income in the world. Qatar did not experience domestic unrest or violence like that seen in other Near Eastern and North African countries in 2010-11, due in part to its immense wealth. Since the outbreak of regional unrest, however, Doha has prided itself on its support for many of these popular revolutions, particularly in Libya and Syria, although to the detriment of Qatar’s relations with Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which temporarily recalled their respective ambassadors from Qatar. In mid-2013, HAMAD transferred power to his 33 year-old son, the current Amir TAMIM bin Hamad - a peaceful abdication rare in the history of Arab Gulf states. TAMIM oversaw a warming of Qatar’s relations with Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE by later in 2014 and prioritized improving the domestic welfare of Qataris, including establishing advanced healthcare and education systems and expanding the country's infrastructure in anticipation of Doha's hosting of the 2022 World Cup.","communications":{"country_id":"QA","fixed_phones_total":"428,858","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"20 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"3.61 million","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"164 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"modern system centered in Doha","phone_system_international":"country code - 974; landing point for the Fiber-Optic Link Around the Globe (FLAG) submarine cable network that provides links to Asia, Middle East, Europe, and the US; tropospheric scatter to Bahrain; microwave radio relay to Saudi Arabia and the UAE; sa (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"combined fixed-line and mobile-cellular telephone subscribership exceeds 180 telephones per 100 persons","broadcast_media":"TV and radio broadcast licensing and access to local media markets are state controlled; home of the satellite TV channel Al-Jazeera, which was originally owned and financed by the Qatari government but has evolved to independent corporate status; Al-Jaze (2014)","internet_country_code":"qa","internet_total_users":"2.039 million","internet_population_percent":"92.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:00","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:00"},"economy":{"country_id":"QA","overview":"Qatar has prospered in the last several years with continued high real GDP growth, but low oil prices have dampened the outlook. Qatar was the only Gulf Cooperation Council member that avoided a budget deficit in 2015, but it projects a $12.8 billion deficit, 6% of GDP in 2016. ++  ++ GDP is driven largely by the oil and gas sector; however, growth in manufacturing, construction, and financial services have lifted the non-oil sectors to just over half of Qatar’s nominal GDP. Economic policy is focused on sustaining Qatar's non-associated natural gas reserves and increasing private and foreign investment in non-energy sectors, but oil and gas still account for roughly 92% of export earnings, and 56% of government revenues. Oil and gas have made Qatar the world's highest per-capita income country and the country with the lowest unemployment. Proved oil reserves in excess of 25 billion barrels should enable continued output at current levels for about 56 years. Qatar's proved reserves of natural gas exceed 25 trillion cubic meters, about 13% of the world total and third largest in the world. ++  ++ Qatar's successful 2022 World Cup bid is accelerating large-scale infrastructure projects such as its metro system, light rail system, construction of a new port, roads, stadiums and related sporting infrastructure.","gdp_power_parity":"$334.5 billion (2016 est.) ++ $325.9 billion (2015 est.) ++ $314.4 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"2.6% (2016 est.) ++ 3.7% (2015 est.) ++ 4% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$129,700 (2016 est.) ++ $134,600 (2015 est.) ++ $140,700 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"25.7%","gdp_consumption":"22.6%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"44.8%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"1.7%","gdp_exports":"46.5%","gdp_imports":"-41.3% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"0.1%","gdp_sector_industry":"51.1%","gdp_sector_services":"48.8% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"fruits, vegetables;
