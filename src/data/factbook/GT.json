In 1996, the government signed a peace agreement formally ending the internal conflict, which had left more than 200,000 people dead and had created, by some estimates, about 1 million refugees.","communications":{"country_id":"GT","fixed_phones_total":"1,718,851","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"12 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"18.121 million","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"121 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"fairly modern network centered in the city of Guatemala","phone_system_international":"country code - 502; landing point for both the Americas Region Caribbean Ring System (ARCOS-1) and the SAM-1 fiber-optic submarine cable system that, together, provide connectivity to South and Central America, parts of the Caribbean, and the US; connecte (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"state-owned telecommunications company privatized in the late 1990s opened the way for competition; fixed-line teledensity roughly 10 per 100 persons; fixed-line investments are being concentrated on improving rural connectivity; mobile-cellular teledensi","broadcast_media":"4 privately owned national terrestrial TV channels dominate TV broadcasting; multi-channel satellite and cable services are available; 1 government-owned radio station and hundreds of privately owned radio stations (2007)","internet_country_code":"gt","internet_total_users":"4.043 million","internet_population_percent":"27.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:59","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:59"},"economy":{"country_id":"GT","overview":"Guatemala is the most populous country in Central America with a GDP per capita roughly half the average for Latin America and the Caribbean. The agricultural sector accounts for 13.6% of GDP and 31% of the labor force; key agricultural exports include sugar, coffee, bananas, and vegetables. Guatemala is the top remittance recipient in Central America as a result of Guatemala's large expatriate community in the US. These inflows are a primary source of foreign income, equivalent to over one-half of the country's exports or one-tenth of its GDP. ++  ++ The 1996 peace accords, which ended 36 years of civil war, removed a major obstacle to foreign investment, and since then Guatemala has pursued important reforms and macroeconomic stabilization. The Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) entered into force in July 2006, spurring increased investment and diversification of exports, with the largest increases in ethanol and non-traditional agricultural exports. While CAFTA-DR has helped improve the investment climate, concerns over security, the lack of skilled workers, and poor infrastructure continue to hamper foreign direct investment. ++  ++ The distribution of income remains highly unequal with the richest 20% of the population accounting for more than 51% of Guatemala's overall consumption. More than half of the population is below the national poverty line, and 23% of the population lives in extreme poverty. Poverty among indigenous groups, which make up more than 40% of the population, averages 79%, with 39.8% of the indigenous population living in extreme poverty. Nearly one-half of Guatemala's children under age five are chronically malnourished, one of the highest malnutrition rates in the world. ++  ++ Guatemala is facing growing fiscal pressures exacerbated by multiple corruption scandals in 2015 that led to the resignation of the president, vice president, and numerous high-level economic officials.","gdp_power_parity":"$132.3 billion (2016 est.) ++ $127.9 billion (2015 est.) ++ $122.8 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"3.5% (2016 est.) ++ 4.1% (2015 est.) ++ 4.2% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$7,900 (2016 est.) ++ $7,900 (2015 est.) ++ $7,700 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"84.4%","gdp_consumption":"10.4%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"13.3%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"0.5%","gdp_exports":"21.4%","gdp_imports":"-30% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"13.2%","gdp_sector_industry":"23.5%","gdp_sector_services":"63.3% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"sugarcane, corn, bananas, coffee, beans, cardamom;
