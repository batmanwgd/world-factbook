It gained complete independence in 1917. During World War II, Finland successfully defended its independence through cooperation with Germany and resisted subsequent invasions by the Soviet Union - albeit with some loss of territory. In the subsequent half century, Finland transformed from a farm\/forest economy to a diversified modern industrial economy; per capita income is among the highest in Western Europe. A member of the EU since 1995, Finland was the only Nordic state to join the euro single currency at its initiation in January 1999. In the 21st century, the key features of Finland's modern welfare state are high quality education, promotion of equality, and a national social welfare system - currently challenged by an aging population and the fluctuations of an export-driven economy.","communications":{"country_id":"FI","fixed_phones_total":"537,000","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"10 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"7.399 million","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"135 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"modern system with excellent service","phone_system_international":"country code - 358; submarine cables provide links to Estonia and Sweden; satellite earth stations - access to Intelsat transmission service via a Swedish satellite earth station, 1 Inmarsat (Atlantic and Indian Ocean regions); note - Finland shares the I (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"digital fiber-optic, fixed-line network and an extensive mobile-cellular network provide domestic needs","broadcast_media":"a mix of publicly operated TV stations and privately owned TV stations; in 2008, the 2 publicly owned TV stations expanded services and the largest private TV station has introduced several special-interest pay-TV channels; cable and satellite multi-chann (2008)","internet_country_code":"fi","internet_total_users":"5.074 million","internet_population_percent":"92.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58"},"economy":{"country_id":"FI","overview":"Finland has a highly industrialized, largely free-market economy with per capita GDP almost as high as that of Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, or Sweden. Trade is important, with exports accounting for over one-third of GDP in recent years. ++  ++ Finland is historically competitive in manufacturing - principally the wood, metals, engineering, telecommunications, and electronics industries. Finland excels in export of technology for mobile phones as well as promotion of startups in the information and communications technology, gaming, cleantech, and biotechnology sectors. Except for timber and several minerals, Finland depends on imports of raw materials, energy, and some components for manufactured goods. Because of the cold climate, agricultural development is limited to maintaining self-sufficiency in basic products. Forestry, an important export industry, provides a secondary occupation for the rural population. ++  ++ Finland had been one of the best performing economies within the EU before 2009 and its banks and financial markets avoided the worst of global financial crisis. However, the world slowdown hit exports and domestic demand hard in that year, causing Finland’s economy to contract from 2012-14. The recession affected general government finances and the debt ratio. ++  ++ Finland's main challenges will be reducing high labor costs and boosting demand for its exports. In the long term, Finland must address a rapidly aging population and decreasing productivity in traditional industries that threaten competitiveness, fiscal sustainability, and economic growth. The depreciating ruble and Russia’s general economic slowdown will dampen exports to Russia.","gdp_power_parity":"$230 billion (2016 est.) ++ $227.9 billion (2015 est.) ++ $227.4 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"0.9% (2016 est.) ++ 0.2% (2015 est.) ++ -0.7% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$41,800 (2016 est.) ++ $41,600 (2015 est.) ++ $41,700 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"55.1%","gdp_consumption":"24.2%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"20.2%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"-0.1%","gdp_exports":"35.4%","gdp_imports":"-34.8% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"2.5%","gdp_sector_industry":"26.9%","gdp_sector_services":"70.6% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"barley, wheat, sugar beets, potatoes;
