{"id":"CC","iso_a3":"CCK","fips":"CK","continent":"AS","name":"Cocos [Keeling] Islands","introduction":"There are 27 coral islands in the group. Captain William KEELING discovered the islands in 1609, but they remained uninhabited until the 19th century. From the 1820s to 1978, members of the CLUNIE-ROSS family controlled the islands and the copra produced from local coconuts. Annexed by the UK in 1857, the Cocos Islands were transferred to the Australian Government in 1955. Apart from North Keeling Island, which lies 30 kilometers north of the main group, the islands form a horseshoe-shaped atoll surrounding a lagoon. North Keeling Island was declared a national park in 1995 and is administered by Parks Australia. The population on the two inhabited islands generally is split between the ethnic Europeans on West Island and the ethnic Malays on Home Island.","communications":{"country_id":"CC","fixed_phones_total":"","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"","mobile_phones_total":"","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"","phone_system_general_assessment":"","phone_system_international":"country code - 599","phone_system_domestic":"","broadcast_media":"government-run Telecuracao operates a TV station and a radio station; several privately owned radio stations","internet_country_code":"cw","internet_total_users":"138,750","internet_population_percent":"93.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58"},"economy":{"country_id":"CC","overview":"Most of Curacaoâ€™s GDP results from services. Tourism, petroleum refining and bunkering, offshore finance, and transportation and communications are the mainstays of this small island economy, which is closely tied to the outside world. Curacao has limited natural resources, poor soil, and inadequate water supplies, and budgetary problems complicate reform of the health and education systems. Although GDP grew only slightly during the past decade, Curacao enjoys a high per capita income and a well-developed infrastructure compared with other countries in the region. ++  ++ Curacao has an excellent natural harbor that can accommodate large oil tankers, and the port of Willemstad hosts a free trade zone and a dry dock. Venezuelan state oil company PdVSA, under a contract in effect until 2019, leases the single refinery on the island from the government, directly employing some 1,000 people; most of the oil for the refinery is imported from Venezuela; most of the refined products are exported to the US and Asia. Almost all consumer and capital goods are imported, with the US, the Netherlands and Venezuela being the major suppliers. ++  ++ The government is attempting to diversify its industry and trade and has signed an Association Agreement with the EU to expand business there. In 2013, the government implemented changes to the sales tax and reformed the public pension and health care systems, including increasing the sales tax from 5% to as high as 9% on some products, raising the age for public pension withdrawals to 65, and requiring citizens to pay higher premiums.","gdp_power_parity":"$3.128 billion (2012 est.) ++ $3.02 billion (2011 est.) ++ $2.96 billion (2010 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"3.6% (2012 est.) ++ 2% (2011 est.) ++ 0.1% (2010 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$15,000 (2004 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"","gdp_consumption":"","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"","gdp_exports":"","gdp_imports":"","gdp_sector_agriculture":"0.7%","gdp_sector_industry":"15.5%","gdp_sector_services":"83.8% (2012 est.)","agriculture_products":"aloe, sorghum, peanuts, vegetables, tropical fruit","industries":"tourism, petroleum refining, petroleum transshipment, light manufacturing, financial and business services","industrial_growth_rate":"NA%","labor_force":"73,010 (2013)","labor_force_notes":"","labor_force_services":"81.8% (2008 est.)","labor_force_industry":"16.9%","labor_force_agriculture":"1.2%","labor_force_occupation_notes":"","unemployment_rate":"13% (2013 est.) ++ 9.8% (2011 est.)","population_below_poverty":"","household_income_lowest_10":"","household_income_highest_10":"","budget_revenues":"","taxes_revenues":"16.6% of GDP (2012 est.)","budget_net":"-0.4% of GDP (2012 est.)","public_debt":"33.2% of GDP (2012 est.) ++ 40.6% of GDP (2011 est.)","external_debt":"","fiscal_year":"","inflation_rate":"2.6% (2013 est.) ++ 2.8% (2012 est.)","central_bank_discount_rate":"","commercial_bank_prime_lending_rate":"","stock_money_narrow":"","stock_money_broad":"","stock_domestic_credit":"","exports":"$1.607 billion (2011 est.) ++ $1.44 billion (2010 est.)","exports_commodities":"petroleum products","exports_partners":"","imports":"$1.285 billion (2011 est.) ++ $1.275 billion (2010 est.)","imports_commodities":"crude petroleum, food, manufactures","imports_partners":"","exchange_rates":"Netherlands Antillean guilders (ANG) per US dollar - ++ 1.79 (2015 est.) ++ 1.79 (2014 est.) ++ 1.79 (2013) ++ 1.79 (2012 est.)","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58"},"energy":{"country_id":"CC","electricity_production":"1.785 billion kWh (2012 est.)","electricity_consumption":"968 million kWh (2008 est.)","electricity_exports":"0 kWh (2009 est.)","electricity_imports":"0 kWh (2009 est.)","electricity_generating_capacity":"","electricity_fossil_fuels":"","electricity_nuclear":"","electricity_hydroelectric":"","electricity_renewable":"","crude_oil_production":"","crude_oil_exports":"","crude_oil_imports":"","crude_oil_reserves":"0 bbl (1 January 2011 es)","petrol_production":"531.1 bbl\/day (2010 est.)","petrol_consumption":"72,000 bbl\/day (2010 est.)","petrol_exports":"211,100 bbl\/day (2009 est.)","petrol_imports":"291,700 bbl\/day (2009 est.)","natural_gas_production":"0 cu m (2009 est.)","natural_gas_consumption":"0 cu m (2009 est.)","natural_gas_exports":"0 cu m (2009 est.)","natural_gas_imports":"0 cu m (2009 est.)","natural_gas_reserves":"0 cu m (1 January 2011 es)","co2_output":"","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58"},"geography":{"country_id":"CC","location_description":"Caribbean, an island in the Caribbean Sea, 30 nm off the coast of Venezuela","latitude":"-12.1641650","longitude":"96.8709560","mapReferences":"Central America and the Caribbean","area_sqkm_total":444,"area_sqkm_land":444,"area_sqkm_water":0,"area_km_coastline":364,"area_note":"more than twice the size of Washington, DC","climate":"tropical marine climate, ameliorated by northeast trade winds, results in mild temperatures;
