The following year the southern portion of neighboring British Cameroon voted to merge with the new country to form the Federal Republic of Cameroon.

The country has generally enjoyed stability, which has enabled the development of agriculture, roads, and railways, as well as a petroleum industry. Despite slow movement toward democratic reform, political power remains firmly in the hands of President Paul BIYA.","communications":{"country_id":"CM","fixed_phones_total":"1,054,978","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"4 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"16.807 million","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"71 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"system includes cable, microwave radio relay, and tropospheric scatter; Camtel, the monopoly provider of fixed-line service, provides connections for only about 4 per 100 persons; equipment is old and outdated, and connections with many parts of the count","phone_system_international":"country code - 237; landing point for the SAT-3\/WASC fiber-optic submarine cable that provides connectivity to Europe and Asia; satellite earth stations - 2 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean) (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"mobile-cellular usage, in part a reflection of the poor condition and general inadequacy of the fixed-line network, has increased sharply, reaching a subscribership base of 70 per 100 persons","broadcast_media":"government maintains tight control over broadcast media; state-owned Cameroon Radio Television (CRTV), broadcasting on both a TV and radio network, was the only officially recognized and fully licensed broadcaster until August 2007, when the government fi (2007)","internet_country_code":"cm","internet_total_users":"4.909 million","internet_population_percent":"20.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58"},"economy":{"country_id":"CM","overview":"Modest oil resources and favorable agricultural conditions provide Cameroon with one of the best-endowed primary commodity economies in Sub-Saharan Africa. Oil remains Cameroon’s main export commodity, and despite falling global oil prices, still accounts for nearly 40% of export earnings. Cameroon’s economy suffers from factors that often impact underdeveloped countries, such as stagnant per capita income, a relatively inequitable distribution of income, a top-heavy civil service, endemic corruption, continuing inefficiencies of a large parastatal system in key sectors, and a generally unfavorable climate for business enterprise. ++  ++ Since 1990, the government has embarked on various IMF and World Bank programs designed to spur business investment, increase efficiency in agriculture, improve trade, and recapitalize the nation's banks. The IMF continues to press for economic reforms, including increased budget transparency, privatization, and poverty reduction programs. The Government of Cameroon provides subsidies for electricity, food, and fuel that have strained the federal budget and diverted funds from education, healthcare, and infrastructure projects, especially in 2015, as low oil prices have led to lower revenues. ++  ++ Cameroon devotes significant resources to several large infrastructure projects currently under construction, including a deep sea port in Kribi and the Lom Pangar Hydropower Project. Cameroon’s energy sector continues to diversify, recently opening a natural gas powered electricity generating plant. Cameroon continues to seek foreign investment to improve its inadequate infrastructure, create jobs, and improve its economic footprint, but its unfavorable business environment remains a significant deterrent to foreign investment.","gdp_power_parity":"$77.24 billion (2016 est.) ++ $73.7 billion (2015 est.) ++ $69.66 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"4.8% (2016 est.) ++ 5.8% (2015 est.) ++ 5.9% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$3,300 (2016 est.) ++ $3,200 (2015 est.) ++ $3,100 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"76.8%","gdp_consumption":"12.1%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"22.7%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"0.2%","gdp_exports":"20.3%","gdp_imports":"-32.1% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"21.3%","gdp_sector_industry":"30.8%","gdp_sector_services":"47.9% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"coffee, cocoa, cotton, rubber, bananas, oilseed, grains, cassava (manioc, tapioca);
