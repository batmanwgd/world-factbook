Vikings reached the island in the 10th century from Iceland; Danish colonization began in the 18th century, and Greenland became an integral part of the Danish Realm in 1953. It joined the European Community (now the EU) with Denmark in 1973 but withdrew in 1985 over a dispute centered on stringent fishing quotas. Greenland remains a member of the Overseas Countries and Territories Association of the EU. Greenland was granted self-government in 1979 by the Danish parliament; the law went into effect the following year. Greenland voted in favor of increased self-rule in November 2008 and acquired greater responsibility for internal affairs when the Act on Greenland Self-Government was signed into law in June 2009. Denmark, however, continues to exercise control over several policy areas on behalf of Greenland, including foreign affairs, security, and financial policy in consultation with Greenland's Self-Rule Government.","communications":{"country_id":"GL","fixed_phones_total":"16,000","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"28 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"61,000","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"106 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"adequate domestic and international service provided by satellite, cables, and microwave radio relay; totally digital since 1995","phone_system_international":"country code - 299; satellite earth stations - 15 (12 Intelsat, 1 Eutelsat, 2 Americom GE-2 (all Atlantic Ocean)) (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"microwave radio relay and satellite; the fundamental telecommunications infrastructure consists of a digital radio link from Nanortalik in south Greenland to Uummannaq in north Greenland; satellites cover north and east Greenland for domestic and foreign","broadcast_media":"the Greenland Broadcasting Company provides public radio and TV services throughout the island with a broadcast station and a series of repeaters; a few private local TV and radio stations; Danish public radio rebroadcasts are available (2015)","internet_country_code":"gl","internet_total_users":"39,000","internet_population_percent":"67.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:59","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:59"},"economy":{"country_id":"GL","overview":"The economy remains critically dependent on exports of shrimp and fish, income from resource exploration and extraction, and on a substantial subsidy from the Danish Government. The subsidy was budgeted to be about $535 million in 2015, approximately 56% of government revenues that year. ++  ++ The public sector, including publicly owned enterprises and the municipalities, plays the dominant role in Greenland's economy. Greenland's real GDP contracted about 5% from 2012 to 2014. Real growth is projected for 2015 and 2016 due to increasing world prices for fish and shellfish, public construction activities, and to a small degree from increased revenues from small-scale mining. ++  ++ During the last decade the Greenland Home Rule Government pursued conservative fiscal and monetary policies, but public pressure has increased for better schools, health care, and retirement systems. The public budget exhibited a deficit of 2% of GDP in 2014, but public debt remains low at about 5% of GDP. ++  ++ The Greenlandic economy has benefited from increasing catches and exports of shrimp, Greenland halibut and, more recently, mackerel. Due to Greenland's continued dependence on exports of fish - which accounted for 91% of exports in 2015 - the economy remains very sensitive to external demand and price fluctuations. ++  ++ The Greenlandic economy is expected to expand in 2016, but significant challenges face the island. High unemployment, structural challenges stemming from low levels of qualified labor, geographic dispersion, an undiversified economy, the long-term sustainability of the public budget, and a declining population due to emigration. Catches in fisheries have been declining in recent years and a reversal in prices will quickly lead to vulnerabilities. Hydrocarbon exploration has ceased with declining oil prices and currently only three mines are under development. The island has potential for natural resource exploitation with rare-earth, uranium, and iron ore mineral projects proposed. ++  ++ Tourism offers another avenue of economic growth for Greenland, with increasing numbers of cruise lines now operating in Greenland's western and southern waters during the peak summer tourism season.","gdp_power_parity":"$2.173 billion (2014 est.) ++ $2.154 billion (2013 est.) ++ $2.165 billion (2012 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"0.9% (2014 est.) ++ -0.5% (2013 est.) ++ 1.5% (2012 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$37,900 (2008 est.) ++ $38,100 (2007 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"","gdp_consumption":"","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"","gdp_exports":"","gdp_imports":"","gdp_sector_agriculture":"13.9%","gdp_sector_industry":"19.2%","gdp_sector_services":"67% (2012 est.)","agriculture_products":"sheep, cow, reindeer, fish","industries":"fish processing (mainly shrimp and Greenland halibut);
