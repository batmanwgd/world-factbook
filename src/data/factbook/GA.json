President BONGO introduced a nominal multiparty system and a new constitution in the early 1990s. However, allegations of electoral fraud during local elections in December 2002 and the presidential election in 2005 exposed the weaknesses of formal political structures in Gabon. Following President BONGO's death in 2009, a new election brought Ali BONGO Ondimba, son of the former president, to power. Despite constrained political conditions, Gabon's small population, abundant natural resources, and considerable foreign support have helped make it one of the more stable African countries.","communications":{"country_id":"GA","fixed_phones_total":"45,000","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"2 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"2.586 million","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"131 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"adequate microwave radio relay and open-wire network; state-owned Gambia Telecommunications partially privatized in 2007","phone_system_international":"country code - 220; microwave radio relay links to Senegal and Guinea-Bissau; a landing station for the Africa Coast to Europe (ACE) undersea fiber-optic cable completed in 2011 and launched in 2012; satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean) (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"combined fixed-line and mobile-cellular teledensity, aided by multiple mobile-cellular providers, is roughly 130 per 100 persons","broadcast_media":"state-owned, single-channel TV service; state-owned radio station and 15 privately owned radio stations; 6 community radio stations; transmissions of multiple international broadcasters are available, some via shortwave radio; cable and satellite TV subsc (2015)","internet_country_code":"gm","internet_total_users":"337,000","internet_population_percent":"17.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58"},"economy":{"country_id":"GA","overview":"The government has invested strongly in the agriculture sector because three-quarters of the population depends on the sector for its livelihood and agriculture provides for another one-fifth of GDP. The agricultural sector has untapped potential - less than half of arable land is cultivated. Small-scale manufacturing activity features the processing of peanuts, fish, and hides. The Gambia's re-export trade accounts for almost 80% of goods exports and China has been its largest trade partner for both exports and imports for several years. ++  ++ The Gambia has sparse natural resource deposits and a limited agricultural base. It relies heavily on remittances from workers overseas and tourist receipts. Remittance inflows to The Gambia amount to about one-fifth of the country’s GDP. The Gambia's natural beauty and proximity to Europe has made it one of the larger tourist destinations in West Africa, boosted by government and private sector investments in eco-tourism and upscale facilities. Tourism normally brings in about 20% of GDP, but suffered in 2014 from tourists’ fears of Ebola virus in neighboring West African countries. Unemployment and underemployment remain high. ++  ++ Economic progress depends on sustained bilateral and multilateral aid, on responsible government economic management, and on continued technical assistance from multilateral and bilateral donors. International donors and lenders continue to be concerned about the quality of fiscal management. The IMF provided $10.8 million in emergency financial assistance to The Gambia in April 2015 to shore up the country’s finances. Relations with international donors have been tarnished by the country’s human rights record.","gdp_power_parity":"$3.387 billion (2016 est.) ++ $3.31 billion (2015 est.) ++ $3.172 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"2.3% (2016 est.) ++ 4.4% (2015 est.) ++ -0.2% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$1,700 (2016 est.) ++ $1,700 (2015 est.) ++ $1,600 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"80.7%","gdp_consumption":"9.7%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"19.1%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"-1.5%","gdp_exports":"24.8%","gdp_imports":"-32.8% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"21.4%","gdp_sector_industry":"15.6%","gdp_sector_services":"63% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"rice, millet, sorghum, peanuts, corn, sesame, cassava (manioc, tapioca), palm kernels;
