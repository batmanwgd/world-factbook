Gabon relied on timber and manganese exports until oil was discovered offshore in the early 1970s. From 2010 to 2014, oil accounted for approximately 80% of Gabonâ€™s exports, 45% of its GDP, and 60% of its state budget revenues. ++  ++ Gabon faces fluctuating prices for its oil, timber, and manganese exports. A rebound of oil prices from 2001 to 2013 helped growth, but declining production, as some fields passed their peak production, has hampered Gabon from fully realizing potential gains. GDP grew nearly 6% per year over the 2010-14 period, but slowed significantly in 2015 as oil prices declined. Low oil prices also weakened government revenue and negatively affected the trade and current account balances. ++  ++ Despite an abundance of natural wealth, poor fiscal management and over-reliance on oil has stifled the economy. There are frequent power cuts and water shortages. However, President BONGO has made efforts to increase transparency and is taking steps to make Gabon a more attractive investment destination to diversify the economy. BONGO has attempted to boost growth by increasing government investment in human resources and infrastructure.","gdp_power_parity":"$36.22 billion (2016 est.) ++ $35.1 billion (2015 est.) ++ $33.75 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"3.2% (2016 est.) ++ 4% (2015 est.) ++ 4.3% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$19,300 (2016 est.) ++ $18,900 (2015 est.) ++ $18,500 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"40.8%","gdp_consumption":"15.8%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"31.1%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"0.1%","gdp_exports":"39.8%","gdp_imports":"-27.6% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"4.5%","gdp_sector_industry":"46.4%","gdp_sector_services":"49.1% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"cocoa, coffee, sugar, palm oil, rubber;
