{"id":"DJ","iso_a3":"DJI","fips":"DJ","continent":"AF","name":"Djibouti","introduction":"The French Territory of the Afars and the Issas became Djibouti in 1977. Hassan Gouled APTIDON installed an authoritarian one-party state and proceeded to serve as president until 1999. Unrest among the Afar minority during the 1990s led to a civil war that ended in 2001 with a peace accord between Afar rebels and the Somali Issa-dominated government. In 1999, Djibouti's first multiparty presidential election resulted in the election of Ismail Omar GUELLEH as president; he was reelected to a second term in 2005 and extended his tenure in office via a constitutional amendment, which allowed him to serve a third term in 2011 and begin a fourth term in 2016. Djibouti occupies a strategic geographic location at the intersection of the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden and serves as an important shipping portal for goods entering and leaving the east African highlands and transshipments between Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. The government holds longstanding ties to France, which maintains a significant military presence in the country, and has strong ties with the US. Djibouti hosts several thousand members of US armed services at US-run Camp Lemonnier.","communications":{"country_id":"DJ","fixed_phones_total":"23,000","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"3 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"312,000","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"38 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"telephone facilities in the city of Djibouti are adequate, as are the microwave radio relay connections to outlying areas of the country","phone_system_international":"country code - 253; landing point for the SEA-ME-WE-3 and EASSy fiber-optic submarine cable systems providing links to Asia, the Middle East, Europe and North America; satellite earth stations - 2 (1 Intelsat - Indian Ocean and 1 Arabsat); Medarabtel regi (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"Djibouti Telecom is the sole provider of telecommunications services and utilizes mostly a microwave radio relay network; fiber-optic cable is installed in the capital; rural areas connected via wireless local loop radio systems; mobile cellular coverage","broadcast_media":"state-owned Radiodiffusion-Television de Djibouti operates the sole terrestrial TV station, as well as the only 2 domestic radio networks; no private TV or radio stations; transmissions of several international broadcasters are available (2007)","internet_country_code":"dj","internet_total_users":"99,000","internet_population_percent":"11.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58"},"economy":{"country_id":"DJ","overview":"Djibouti's economy is based on service activities connected with the country's strategic location as a deepwater port on the Red Sea. Three-fourths of Djibouti's inhabitants live in the capital city; the remainder are mostly nomadic herders. Scant rainfall and less than 4% arable land limits crop production to small quantities of fruits and vegetables, and most food must be imported. ++  ++ Djibouti provides services as both a transit port for the region and an international transshipment and refueling center. Imports, exports, and re-exports represent 70% of port activity at Djibouti's container terminal. Reexports consist primarily of coffee from landlocked neighbor Ethiopia. Djibouti has few natural resources and little industry. The nation is, therefore, heavily dependent on foreign assistance to help support its balance of payments and to finance development projects. An official unemployment rate of nearly 50% - with youth unemployment near 80% - continues to be a major problem. Inflation declined to 3% in 2014 due to low international food prices and a decline in electricity tariffs. ++  ++ Djibouti’s reliance on diesel-generated electricity and imported food and water leave average consumers vulnerable to global price shocks, though in mid-2015 Djibouti passed new legislation to liberalize the energy sector. The government has emphasized infrastructure development for transportation and energy and Djibouti – with the help of foreign partners – has begun to increase and modernize its port capacity.","gdp_power_parity":"$3.345 billion (2016 est.) ++ $3.141 billion (2015 est.) ++ $2.949 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"6.5% (2016 est.) ++ 6.5% (2015 est.) ++ 6% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$3,400 (2016 est.) ++ $3,300 (2015 est.) ++ $3,100 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"60.5%","gdp_consumption":"32%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"42.2%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"0.4%","gdp_exports":"34.8%","gdp_imports":"-69.9% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"2.9%","gdp_sector_industry":"20.8%","gdp_sector_services":"76.3% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"fruits, vegetables;
