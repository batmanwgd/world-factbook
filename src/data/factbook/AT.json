{"id":"AT","iso_a3":"AUT","fips":"AU","continent":"EU","name":"Austria","introduction":"Once the center of power for the large Austro-Hungarian Empire, Austria was reduced to a small republic after its defeat in World War I. Following annexation by Nazi Germany in 1938 and subsequent occupation by the victorious Allies in 1945, Austria's status remained unclear for a decade. A State Treaty signed in 1955 ended the occupation, recognized Austria's independence, and forbade unification with Germany. A constitutional law that same year declared the country's \"perpetual neutrality\" as a condition for Soviet military withdrawal. The Soviet Union's collapse in 1991 and Austria's entry into the EU in 1995 have altered the meaning of this neutrality. A prosperous, democratic country, Austria entered the EU Economic and Monetary Union in 1999.","communications":null,"economy":{"country_id":"AT","overview":"no economic activity","gdp_power_parity":"","gdp_real_growth":"","gdp_per_capita":"","gdp_household_consumption":"","gdp_consumption":"","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"","gdp_exports":"","gdp_imports":"","gdp_sector_agriculture":"","gdp_sector_industry":"","gdp_sector_services":"","agriculture_products":"","industries":"","industrial_growth_rate":"","labor_force":"","labor_force_notes":"","labor_force_services":"","labor_force_industry":"","labor_force_agriculture":"","labor_force_occupation_notes":"","unemployment_rate":"","population_below_poverty":"","household_income_lowest_10":"","household_income_highest_10":"","budget_revenues":"","taxes_revenues":"","budget_net":"","public_debt":"","external_debt":"","fiscal_year":"","inflation_rate":"","central_bank_discount_rate":"","commercial_bank_prime_lending_rate":"","stock_money_narrow":"","stock_money_broad":"","stock_domestic_credit":"","exports":"","exports_commodities":"","exports_partners":"","imports":"","imports_commodities":"","imports_partners":"","exchange_rates":"","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:57","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:57"},"energy":null,"geography":{"country_id":"AT","location_description":"Southeastern Asia, islands in the Indian Ocean, midway between northwestern Australia and Timor island","latitude":"47.5162310","longitude":"14.5500720","mapReferences":"Southeast Asia","area_sqkm_total":5,"area_sqkm_land":5,"area_sqkm_water":0,"area_km_coastline":74,"area_note":"about eight times the size of the National Mall in Washington, DC","climate":"tropical","terrain":"low with sand and coral","hazards":"surrounded by shoals and reefs that can pose maritime hazards","notes":"Ashmore Reef National Nature Reserve established in August 1983;
