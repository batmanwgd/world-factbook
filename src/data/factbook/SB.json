The economy has been declining, however, because of disputes with Canada over fishing quotas and a steady decline in the number of ships stopping at Saint Pierre. ++  ++ In 1992, an arbitration panel awarded the islands an exclusive economic zone of 12,348 sq km to settle a longstanding territorial dispute with Canada, although it represents only 25% of what France had sought. France heavily subsidizes the islands to the great betterment of living standards. ++  ++ The government hopes an expansion of tourism will boost economic prospects. Fish farming, crab fishing, and agriculture are being developed to diversify the local economy. Recent test drilling for oil may pave the way for development of the energy sector.","gdp_power_parity":"$215.3 million (2006 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"NA%","gdp_per_capita":"$34,900 (2006 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"","gdp_consumption":"","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"","gdp_exports":"","gdp_imports":"","gdp_sector_agriculture":"2%","gdp_sector_industry":"15%","gdp_sector_services":"83% (2006 est.)","agriculture_products":"vegetables;
