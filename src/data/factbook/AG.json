In recent years the Algerian Government has halted the privatization of state-owned industries and imposed restrictions on imports and foreign involvement in its economy. ++  ++ Hydrocarbons have long been the backbone of the economy, accounting for roughly 60% of budget revenues, 30% of GDP, and over 95% of export earnings. Algeria has the 10th-largest reserves of natural gas in the world and is the sixth-largest gas exporter. It ranks 16th in oil reserves. Hydrocarbon exports have enabled Algeria to maintain macroeconomic stability and amass large foreign currency reserves and a large budget stabilization fund available for tapping. In addition, Algeria's external debt is extremely low at about 2% of GDP. However, Algeria has struggled to develop non-hydrocarbon industries because of heavy regulation and an emphasis on state-driven growth. ++  ++ The government's efforts have done little to reduce high youth unemployment rates or to address housing shortages. A wave of economic protests in February and March 2011 prompted the Algerian Government to offer more than $23 billion in public grants and retroactive salary and benefit increases, moves which continue to weigh on public finances. Since late 2014, declining oil prices forced the government to spend down its reserves at a high rate in order to sustain social spending on salaries and subsidies, particularly since the government has been unable to boost exports of hydrocarbons or significantly grow its nonoil sector. In 2015, the Algerian Government imposed further restrictions on imports in an effort to reduce withdrawals from its foreign exchange reserves. The Government also increased the value-added tax on electricity and fuel, but said it would address subsidies at a later date. ++  ++ Long-term economic challenges include diversifying the economy away from its reliance on hydrocarbon exports, bolstering the private sector, attracting foreign investment, and providing adequate jobs for younger Algerians.","gdp_power_parity":"$609.4 billion (2016 est.) ++ $588.4 billion (2015 est.) ++ $566.3 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"3.6% (2016 est.) ++ 3.9% (2015 est.) ++ 3.8% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$15,000 (2016 est.) ++ $14,700 (2015 est.) ++ $14,500 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"41.5%","gdp_consumption":"22.1%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"42.1%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"6.6%","gdp_exports":"25.1%","gdp_imports":"-37.4% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"13.1%","gdp_sector_industry":"38.7%","gdp_sector_services":"48.2% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"wheat, barley, oats, grapes, olives, citrus, fruits;
