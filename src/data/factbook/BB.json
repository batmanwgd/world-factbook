African slaves worked the sugar plantations established on the island until 1834 when slavery was abolished. The economy remained heavily dependent on sugar, rum, and molasses production through most of the 20th century. The gradual introduction of social and political reforms in the 1940s and 1950s led to complete independence from the UK in 1966. In the 1990s, tourism and manufacturing surpassed the sugar industry in economic importance.","communications":{"country_id":"BB","fixed_phones_total":"156,857","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"54 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"335,000","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"115 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"island-wide automatic telephone system","phone_system_international":"country code - 1-246; landing point for the East Caribbean Fiber System (ECFS) submarine cable with links to 13 other islands in the eastern Caribbean extending from the British Virgin Islands to Trinidad; satellite earth stations - 1 (Intelsat - Atlantic (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"fixed-line teledensity of roughly 55 per 100 persons; mobile-cellular telephone density about 115 per 100 persons","broadcast_media":"government-owned Caribbean Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) operates the lone terrestrial TV station; CBC also operates a multi-channel cable TV subscription service; roughly a dozen radio stations, consisting of a CBC-operated network operating alongside p (2007)","internet_country_code":"bb","internet_total_users":"221,000","internet_population_percent":"76.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:57","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:57"},"economy":{"country_id":"BB","overview":"Barbados is the wealthiest and most developed country in the Eastern Caribbean and enjoys one of the highest per capita incomes in the region. Historically, the Barbadian economy was dependent on sugarcane cultivation and related activities. However, in recent years the economy has diversified into light industry and tourism with about four-fifths of GDP and of exports being attributed to services. Offshore finance and information services are important foreign exchange earners and thrive from having the same time zone as eastern US financial centers and a relatively highly educated workforce. Barbados' tourism, financial services, and construction industries have been hard hit since the onset of the global economic crisis in 2008. Barbados' public debt-to-GDP ratio rose from 56% in 2008 to 101% in 2015. Growth prospects are limited because of a weak tourism outlook and planned austerity measures.","gdp_power_parity":"$4.804 billion (2016 est.) ++ $4.724 billion (2015 est.) ++ $4.682 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"1.7% (2016 est.) ++ 0.9% (2015 est.) ++ 0.2% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$17,200 (2016 est.) ++ $16,900 (2015 est.) ++ $16,800 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"82.5%","gdp_consumption":"14.3%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"14.4%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"3.2%","gdp_exports":"35.1%","gdp_imports":"-49.5% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"2.8%","gdp_sector_industry":"11.7%","gdp_sector_services":"85.5% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"sugarcane, vegetables, cotton","industries":"tourism, sugar, light manufacturing, component assembly for export","industrial_growth_rate":"-1% (2016 est.)","labor_force":"142,500 (2016 est.)","labor_force_notes":"","labor_force_services":"75% (1996 est.)","labor_force_industry":"15%","labor_force_agriculture":"10%","labor_force_occupation_notes":"","unemployment_rate":"11% (2016 est.) ++ 11.3% (2015 est.)","population_below_poverty":"NA%","household_income_lowest_10":"NA%","household_income_highest_10":"NA%","budget_revenues":"","taxes_revenues":"26.8% of GDP (2016 est.)","budget_net":"-6.7% of GDP (2016 est.)","public_debt":"108.9% of GDP (2016 est.) ++ 106.9% of GDP (2015 est.)","external_debt":"$4.49 billion (2010 est.) ++ $668 million (2003 est.)","fiscal_year":"1 April - 31 March","inflation_rate":"1.3% (2016 est.) ++ -1.1% (2015 est.)","central_bank_discount_rate":"7% (31 December 2010) ++ 7% (31 December 2009)","commercial_bank_prime_lending_rate":"8.1% (31 December 2016 est.) ++ 8.1% (31 December 2015 est.)","stock_money_narrow":"$1.888 billion (31 December 2016 est.) ++ $1.831 billion (31 December 2015 est.)","stock_money_broad":"$4.442 billion (31 December 2016 est.) ++ $4.309 billion (31 December 2015 est.)","stock_domestic_credit":"$5.669 billion (31 December 2016 est.) ++ $5.377 billion (31 December 2015 est.)","exports":"$466.7 million (2016 est.) ++ $482.9 million (2015 est.)","exports_commodities":"manufactures, sugar, molasses, rum, other foodstuffs and beverages, chemicals, electrical components","exports_partners":"Trinidad and Tobago 22.5%, US 11.8%, St. Lucia 9.2%, St. Vincent and the Grenadines 5.7%, Antigua and Barbuda 4.7%, St. Kitts and Nevis 4.4%, Guyana 4.2% (2015)","imports":"$1.575 billion (2016 est.) ++ $1.618 billion (2015 est.)","imports_commodities":"consumer goods, machinery, foodstuffs, construction materials, chemicals, fuel, electrical components","imports_partners":"Trinidad and Tobago 39%, US 31.1% (2015)","exchange_rates":"Barbadian dollars (BBD) per US dollar - ++ 2 (2016 est.) ++ 2 (2015 est.) ++ 2 (2014 est.) ++ 2 (2013 est.) ++ 2 (2012 est.)","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:57","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:57"},"energy":{"country_id":"BB","electricity_production":"900 million kWh (2014 est.)","electricity_consumption":"900 million kWh (2014 est.)","electricity_exports":"0 kWh (2013 est.)","electricity_imports":"0 kWh (2013 est.)","electricity_generating_capacity":"200,000 kW (2014 est.)","electricity_fossil_fuels":"100% of total installed capacity (2012 est.)","electricity_nuclear":"0% of total installed capacity (2012 est.)","electricity_hydroelectric":"0% of total installed capacity (2012 est.)","electricity_renewable":"0% of total installed capacity (2012 est.)","crude_oil_production":"1,000 bbl\/day (2015 est.)","crude_oil_exports":"764.5 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","crude_oil_imports":"0 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","crude_oil_reserves":"2.53 million bbl (1 January 2016 es)","petrol_production":"0 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","petrol_consumption":"12,000 bbl\/day (2014 est.)","petrol_exports":"0 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","petrol_imports":"11,490 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","natural_gas_production":"20 million cu m (2014 est.)","natural_gas_consumption":"20 million cu m (2014 est.)","natural_gas_exports":"0 cu m (2013 est.)","natural_gas_imports":"0 cu m (2013 est.)","natural_gas_reserves":"113.3 million cu m (1 January 2016 es)","co2_output":"1.3 million Mt (2013 est.)","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:57","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:57"},"geography":{"country_id":"BB","location_description":"Caribbean, island in the North Atlantic Ocean, northeast of Venezuela","latitude":"13.1938870","longitude":"-59.5431980","mapReferences":"Central America and the Caribbean","area_sqkm_total":430,"area_sqkm_land":430,"area_sqkm_water":0,"area_km_coastline":97,"area_note":"2.5 times the size of Washington, DC","climate":"tropical;
