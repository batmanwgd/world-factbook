The islands' sugar industry was hurt by the emancipation of the slaves in 1834. Manpower was replaced with the importation of contract laborers from India between 1845 and 1917, which boosted sugar production as well as the cocoa industry. The discovery of oil on Trinidad in 1910 added another important export. Independence was attained in 1962. The country is one of the most prosperous in the Caribbean thanks largely to petroleum and natural gas production and processing. Tourism, mostly in Tobago, is targeted for expansion and is growing. The government is coping with a rise in violent crime.","communications":{"country_id":"TT","fixed_phones_total":"2,720","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"less than 1 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"1.377 million","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"112 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"rudimentary service in urban and some rural areas, which is expanding with the entrance of new competitors","phone_system_international":"country code - 670; international service is available (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"system suffered significant damage during the violence associated with independence; limited fixed-line services; mobile-cellular services have been expanding and are now available in urban and most rural areas","broadcast_media":"1 public TV broadcast station broadcasting nationally and 1 public radio broadcaster with stations in each of the 13 administrative districts; 1 commercial TV broadcast station, 3 commercial radio stations, and roughly 20 community radio stations (2012)","internet_country_code":"tl","internet_total_users":"165,000","internet_population_percent":"13.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:01","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:01"},"economy":{"country_id":"TT","overview":"Since gaining independence in 1999, Timor-Leste has faced great challenges in rebuilding its infrastructure, strengthening the civil administration, and generating jobs for young people entering the work force. The development of offshore oil and gas resources has greatly supplemented government revenues. This technology-intensive industry, however, has done little to create jobs in part because there are no production facilities in Timor-Leste. Gas is currently piped to Australia for processing, but Timor-Leste has expressed interest in developing a domestic processing capacity. ++  ++ In June 2005, the National Parliament unanimously approved the creation of the Timor-Leste Petroleum Fund to serve as a repository for all petroleum revenues and to preserve the value of Timor-Leste's petroleum wealth for future generations. The Fund held assets of $16.5 billion, as of December 2014. Oil accounts for 90% of government revenues, and the drop in the price of oil in 2014 has led to concerns about the long-term sustainability of government spending. The Ministry of Finance maintains that the Petroleum Fund is sufficient to sustain government operations for the foreseeable future. ++  ++ Annual government budget expenditures increased markedly between 2009 and 2012 but dropped significantly in 2013-15. Historically, the government failed to spend as much as its budget allowed. The government has focused significant resources on basic infrastructure, including electricity and roads. Limited experience in procurement and infrastructure building has hampered these projects. The underlying economic policy challenge the country faces remains how best to use oil-and-gas wealth to lift the non-oil economy onto a higher growth path and to reduce poverty.","gdp_power_parity":"$4.975 billion (2016 est.) ++ $4.738 billion (2015 est.) ++ $4.545 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"5% (2016 est.) ++ 4.3% (2015 est.) ++ 5.9% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$4,200 (2016 est.) ++ $4,100 (2015 est.) ++ $4,000 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"43%","gdp_consumption":"27.2%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"17.5%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"0%","gdp_exports":"70.8%","gdp_imports":"-58.5% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"7.5%","gdp_sector_industry":"68%","gdp_sector_services":"24.4% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"coffee, rice, corn, cassava (manioc, tapioca), sweet potatoes, soybeans, cabbage, mangoes, bananas, vanilla","industries":"printing, soap manufacturing, handicrafts, woven cloth","industrial_growth_rate":"-5% (2016 est.)","labor_force":"259,800 (2013 est.)","labor_force_notes":"","labor_force_services":"26% (2010)","labor_force_industry":"10%","labor_force_agriculture":"64%","labor_force_occupation_notes":"","unemployment_rate":"11% (2013 est.) ++ 18.4% (2010 est.)","population_below_poverty":"37% (2011 est.)","household_income_lowest_10":"4%","household_income_highest_10":"27% (2007)","budget_revenues":"","taxes_revenues":"12% of GDP (2016 est.)","budget_net":"-100% of GDP (2016 est.)","public_debt":"","external_debt":"$311.5 million (31 December 2014 est.) ++ $687 million (31 December 2013 est.)","fiscal_year":"calendar year","inflation_rate":"-0.8% (2016 est.) ++ 0.6% (2015 est.)","central_bank_discount_rate":"","commercial_bank_prime_lending_rate":"13.5% (31 December 2016 est.) ++ 13.5% (31 December 2015 est.)","stock_money_narrow":"$456.9 million (31 December 2016 est.) ++ $397.7 million (31 December 2015 est.)","stock_money_broad":"$677.8 million (31 December 2015 est.) ++ $599.8 million (31 December 2014 est.)","stock_domestic_credit":"$-200 million (31 December 2016 est.) ++ $-127 million (31 December 2015 est.)","exports":"$18 million (2015 est.) ++ $18 million (2015 est.)","exports_commodities":"oil, coffee, sandalwood, marble","exports_partners":"","imports":"$647.7 million (2015 est.) ++ $647.7 million (2015 est.)","imports_commodities":"food, gasoline, kerosene, machinery","imports_partners":"","exchange_rates":"the US dollar is used","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:01","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:01"},"energy":{"country_id":"TT","electricity_production":"349.4 million kWh (2014 est.)","electricity_consumption":"125.3 million kWh (2014 est.)","electricity_exports":"0 kWh (2014 est.)","electricity_imports":"0 kWh (2014 est.)","electricity_generating_capacity":"NA kW (2012 est.)","electricity_fossil_fuels":"","electricity_nuclear":"","electricity_hydroelectric":"","electricity_renewable":"","crude_oil_production":"67,150 bbl\/day (2015 est.)","crude_oil_exports":"79,260 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","crude_oil_imports":"0 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","crude_oil_reserves":"0 bbl (1 January 2016 es)","petrol_production":"0 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","petrol_consumption":"3,100 bbl\/day (2014 est.)","petrol_exports":"0 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","petrol_imports":"3,055 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","natural_gas_production":"0 cu m (2012 est.)","natural_gas_consumption":"0 cu m (2013 est.)","natural_gas_exports":"6.45 billion cu m (2013 est.)","natural_gas_imports":"0 cu m (2013 est.)","natural_gas_reserves":"200 billion cu m (1 January 2006 es)","co2_output":"500,000 Mt (2013 est.)","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:01","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:01"},"geography":{"country_id":"TT","location_description":"Southeastern Asia, northwest of Australia in the Lesser Sunda Islands at the eastern end of the Indonesian archipelago;
