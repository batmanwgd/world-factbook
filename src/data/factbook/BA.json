Bahrain has few options for covering this deficit, with meager foreign assets and a constrained borrowing ability, stemming in part from a sovereign debt rating averaging just above “junk” status. ++  ++ Oil comprises 86% of Bahraini budget revenues, despite past efforts to diversify its economy and to build communication and transport facilities for multinational firms with business in the Gulf. As part of its diversification plans, Bahrain implemented a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the US in August 2006, the first FTA between the US and a Gulf state. ++  ++ Other major economic activities are production of aluminum - Bahrain's second biggest export after oil - finance, and construction. Bahrain continues to seek new natural gas supplies as feedstock to support its expanding petrochemical and aluminum industries. ++  ++ In 2011 Bahrain experienced economic setbacks as a result of domestic unrest driven by the majority Shia population, however, the economy recovered in 2012-15, partly as a result of improved tourism. In addition to addressing its current fiscal woes, Bahraini authorities face the long-term challenge of boosting Bahrain’s regional competitiveness—especially regarding industry, finance, and tourism—and reconciling revenue constraints with popular pressure to maintain generous state subsidies and a large public sector.","gdp_power_parity":"$66.37 billion (2016 est.) ++ $65 billion (2015 est.) ++ $63.19 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"2.1% (2016 est.) ++ 2.9% (2015 est.) ++ 4.4% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$50,300 (2016 est.) ++ $50,200 (2015 est.) ++ $49,800 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"48.5%","gdp_consumption":"16.6%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"18.7%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"1.2%","gdp_exports":"47.1%","gdp_imports":"-32.1% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"0.3%","gdp_sector_industry":"33.8%","gdp_sector_services":"65.9% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"fruit, vegetables;
