Ghana endured a long series of coups before Lt. Jerry RAWLINGS took power in 1981 and banned political parties. After approving a new constitution and restoring multiparty politics in 1992, RAWLINGS won presidential elections in 1992 and 1996 but was constitutionally prevented from running for a third term in 2000. John KUFUOR succeeded him and was reelected in 2004. John Atta MILLS won the 2008 presidential election and took over as head of state, but he died in July 2012 and was constitutionally succeeded by his vice president, John Dramani MAHAMA, who subsequently won the December 2012 presidential election.","communications":{"country_id":"GH","fixed_phones_total":"275,570","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"1 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"35.008 million","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"133 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"primarily microwave radio relay; wireless local loop has been installed; outdated and unreliable fixed-line infrastructure heavily concentrated in Accra","phone_system_international":"country code - 233; landing point for the SAT-3\/WASC, Main One, and GLO-1 fiber-optic submarine cables that provide connectivity to South Africa, Europe, and Asia; satellite earth stations - 4 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean); microwave radio relay link to Panaf (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"competition among multiple mobile-cellular providers has spurred growth with a subscribership of more than 130 per 100 persons and rising","broadcast_media":"state-owned TV station, 2 state-owned radio networks; several privately owned TV stations and a large number of privately owned radio stations; transmissions of multiple international broadcasters are accessible; several cable and satellite TV subscriptio (2007)","internet_country_code":"gh","internet_total_users":"6.181 million","internet_population_percent":"23.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58"},"economy":{"country_id":"GH","overview":"Ghana's economy was strengthened by a quarter century of relatively sound management, a competitive business environment, and sustained reductions in poverty levels, but in recent years has suffered the consequences of loose fiscal policy, high budget and current account deficits, and a depreciating currency. Ghana has a market-based economy with relatively few policy barriers to trade and investment in comparison with other countries in the region, and Ghana is well-endowed with natural resources. ++  ++ Agriculture accounts for nearly one-quarter of GDP and employs more than half of the workforce, mainly small landholders. The services sector accounts for about half of GDP. Gold and cocoa exports, and individual remittances, are major sources of foreign exchange. Expansion of Ghana’s nascent oil industry has boosted economic growth, but the recent oil price crash reduced by half Ghana’s 2015 oil revenue. Production at Jubilee, Ghana's offshore oilfield, began in mid-December 2010 and currently produces roughly 110,000 barrels per day. The country’s first gas processing plant at Atubao is also producing natural gas from the Jubilee field, providing power to several of Ghana’s thermal power plants. ++  ++ As of 2015, the biggest single economic issue facing Ghana is the lack of consistent electricity. While the MAHAMA administration is taking steps to improve the situation, little progress has been made. Ghana signed a $920 million extended credit facility with the IMF in April 2015 to help it address its growing economic crisis. The IMF fiscal targets will require Ghana to reduce the fiscal deficit by cutting subsidies, decreasing the bloated public sector wage bill, strengthening revenue administration, and increasing revenues. The challenge for Ghana will come as the MAHAMA Administration approaches the November 2016 elections, facing public dissatisfaction in the midst of economic austerity.","gdp_power_parity":"$120.8 billion (2016 est.) ++ $116.9 billion (2015 est.) ++ $112.5 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"3.3% (2016 est.) ++ 3.9% (2015 est.) ++ 4% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$4,400 (2016 est.) ++ $4,300 (2015 est.) ++ $4,300 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"66.6%","gdp_consumption":"19.6%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"24.5%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"0.8%","gdp_exports":"36.7%","gdp_imports":"-48.2% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"19.5%","gdp_sector_industry":"24%","gdp_sector_services":"56.4% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"cocoa, rice, cassava (manioc, tapioca), peanuts, corn, shea nuts, bananas;
