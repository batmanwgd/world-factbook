Kenya’s real GDP growth has averaged over 5% for the last seven years. Since 2014 Kenya has been ranked as a lower middle income country because its per capita GDP crossed a World Bank threshold. While Kenya has a growing entrepreneurial middle class and faster growth, its economic and development trajectory is threatened by weak governance and corruption. Unemployment and under-employment are high, but reliable numbers are hard to find. ++  ++ Agriculture remains the backbone of the Kenyan economy, contributing 25% of GDP. About 80% of Kenya’s population of roughly 42 million work at least part-time in the agricultural sector, including livestock and pastoral activities. Over 75% of agricultural output is from small-scale, rain-fed farming or livestock production. ++  ++ Inadequate infrastructure continues to hamper Kenya’s efforts to improve its economic growth to the 8-10% range so that it can meaningfully address poverty and unemployment. The KENYATTA administration sought external investment in infrastructure development. International financial institutions and donors remain important to Kenya's economic growth and development, but Kenya has also successfully raised capital in the global bond market. Kenya issued its first sovereign bond offering in mid-2014. Nairobi has contracted with a Chinese company to construct a new standard gauge railway connecting Mombasa and Nairobi, with completion expected in 2017. The country is in the process of devolving some state revenues and responsibilities to the counties. Inflationary pressures and sharp currency depreciation peaked in early 2012 but have since abated following low global food and fuel prices and monetary interventions by the Central Bank. Chronic budget deficits, including a shortage of funds in mid-2015, hampered the government’s ability to implement proposed development programs, but the economy is back in balance with many indicators, including foreign exchange reserves, interest rates, inflation, and FDI moving in the right direction. ++  ++ Tourism holds a significant place in Kenya’s economy. Multiple terror attacks by the Somalia-based group al-Shabaab in the time since the 2013 attack on Nairobi’s Westgate mall, which killed at least 67, had a negative effect on international tourism earnings, but the sector is starting to recover. Kenya’s success in hosting a series of incident-free high-profile events in the second half of 2015, including the visit of US President Obama, has helped improve the outlook for tourism.","gdp_power_parity":"$152.7 billion (2016 est.) ++ $144.1 billion (2015 est.) ++ $136.4 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"6% (2016 est.) ++ 5.6% (2015 est.) ++ 5.3% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$3,400 (2016 est.) ++ $3,300 (2015 est.) ++ $3,200 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"77.6%","gdp_consumption":"14.2%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"21.3%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"-0.3%","gdp_exports":"15.2%","gdp_imports":"-28% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"32.7%","gdp_sector_industry":"18%","gdp_sector_services":"49.3% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"tea, coffee, corn, wheat, sugarcane, fruit, vegetables;
