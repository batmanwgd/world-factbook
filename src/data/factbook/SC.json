Roughly 200,000 tourists visited the islands in 2009, but reduced tourism arrivals and foreign investment led to an economic contraction in 2009-2013, and the economy returned to growth only in 2014. Like other tourist destinations in the Caribbean, St. Kitts and Nevis is vulnerable to damage from natural disasters and shifts in tourism demand. ++  ++ Following the 2005 harvest, the government closed the sugar industry after several decades of losses. To compensate for lost jobs, the government has embarked on a program to diversify the agricultural sector and to stimulate other sectors of the economy, such as export-oriented manufacturing and offshore banking. The government has made notable progress in reducing its public debt, from 154% of GDP in 2011 to 83% in 2013, although it still faces one of the highest levels in the world, largely attributable to public enterprise losses.","gdp_power_parity":"$1.427 billion (2016 est.) ++ $1.378 billion (2015 est.) ++ $1.313 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"3.5% (2016 est.) ++ 5% (2015 est.) ++ 6.1% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$25,500 (2016 est.) ++ $24,600 (2015 est.) ++ $23,900 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"58.7%","gdp_consumption":"20.4%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"29.8%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"0%","gdp_exports":"34%","gdp_imports":"-42.9% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"1.3%","gdp_sector_industry":"27.2%","gdp_sector_services":"71.5% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"sugarcane, rice, yams, vegetables, bananas;
