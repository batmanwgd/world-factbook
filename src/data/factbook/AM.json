{"id":"AM","iso_a3":"ARM","fips":"AM","continent":"AS","name":"Armenia","introduction":"Armenia prides itself on being the first nation to formally adopt Christianity (early 4th century). Despite periods of autonomy, over the centuries Armenia came under the sway of various empires including the Roman, Byzantine, Arab, Persian, and Ottoman. During World War I in the western portion of Armenia, the Ottoman Empire instituted a policy of forced resettlement coupled with other harsh practices that resulted in at least 1 million Armenian deaths. The eastern area of Armenia was ceded by the Ottomans to Russia in 1828; this portion declared its independence in 1918, but was conquered by the Soviet Red Army in 1920. ++ Armenian leaders remain preoccupied by the long conflict with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh, a primarily Armenian-populated region, assigned to Soviet Azerbaijan in the 1920s by Moscow. Armenia and Azerbaijan began fighting over the area in 1988; the struggle escalated after both countries attained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. By May 1994, when a cease-fire took hold, ethnic Armenian forces held not only Nagorno-Karabakh but also seven surrounding regions, approximately 14 percent of Azerbaijanâ€™s territory. The economies of both sides have been hurt by their inability to make substantial progress toward a peaceful resolution. ++ Turkey closed the common border with Armenia in 1993 in support of Azerbaijan in its conflict with Armenia over control of Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding areas, further hampering Armenian economic growth. In 2009, senior Armenian leaders began pursuing rapprochement with Turkey, aiming to secure an opening of the border, but Turkey has not yet ratified the Protocols normalizing relations between the two countries. In January 2015, Armenia joined Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan as a member of the Eurasian Economic Union.","communications":{"country_id":"AM","fixed_phones_total":"551,366","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"18 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"3.442 million","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"113 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"telecommunications investments have made major inroads in modernizing and upgrading the outdated telecommunications network inherited from the Soviet era; now 100% privately owned and undergoing modernization and expansion; mobile-cellular services monopo","phone_system_international":"country code - 374; Yerevan is connected to the Trans-Asia-Europe fiber-optic cable through Iran; additional international service is available by microwave radio relay and landline connections to the other countries of the Commonwealth of Independent Sta (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"reliable modern fixed-line and mobile-cellular services are available across Yerevan and in major cities and towns; mobile-cellular coverage available in most rural areas","broadcast_media":"2 public TV networks operating alongside about 40 privately owned TV stations that provide local to near nationwide coverage; major Russian broadcast stations are widely available; subscription cable TV services are available in most regions; Public Radio (2015)","internet_country_code":"am","internet_total_users":"1.78 million","internet_population_percent":"58.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:57","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:57"},"economy":{"country_id":"AM","overview":"Under the old Soviet central planning system, Armenia developed a modern industrial sector, supplying machine tools, textiles, and other manufactured goods to sister republics, in exchange for raw materials and energy. Armenia has since switched to small-scale agriculture and away from the large agroindustrial complexes of the Soviet era. Armenia has only two open trade borders - Iran and Georgia - because its borders with Azerbaijan and Turkey have been closed since 1991 and 1993, respectively, as a result of Armenia's ongoing conflict with Azerbaijan over the separatist Nagorno-Karabakh region. ++  ++ Armenia joined the WTO in January 2003. The government has made some improvements in tax and customs administration in recent years, but anti-corruption measures have been ineffective. Armenia will need to pursue additional economic reforms and strengthen the rule of law in order to regain economic growth and improve economic competitiveness and employment opportunities, especially given its economic isolation from two of its nearest neighbors, Turkey and Azerbaijan. ++  ++ Armenia's geographic isolation, a narrow export base, and pervasive monopolies in important business sectors have made it particularly vulnerable to the sharp deterioration in the global economy and the economic downturn in Russia. Armenia is particularly dependent on Russian commercial and governmental support and most key Armenian infrastructure is Russian-owned and\/or managed, especially in the energy sector, including electricity and natural gas. Remittances from expatriates working in Russia are equivalent to about 20% of GDP and partly offset the country's severe trade imbalance. Armenia joined Russia in the Eurasian Economic Union upon the bloc's launch in January 2015, even though the ruble's sharp depreciation in December 2014 led to currency instability, inflation, and a significant decrease in exports from Armenia to Russia.","gdp_power_parity":"$26.56 billion (2016 est.) ++ $25.73 billion (2015 est.) ++ $24.97 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"3.2% (2016 est.) ++ 3% (2015 est.) ++ 3.6% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$8,900 (2016 est.) ++ $8,600 (2015 est.) ++ $8,400 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"72.5%","gdp_consumption":"13.9%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"20%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"2.5%","gdp_exports":"31.6%","gdp_imports":"-40.5% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"19.6%","gdp_sector_industry":"29.1%","gdp_sector_services":"51.3% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"fruit (especially grapes), vegetables;
