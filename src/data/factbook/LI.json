Occupied by both French and Russian troops during the Napoleonic Wars, it became a sovereign state in 1806 and joined the Germanic Confederation in 1815. Liechtenstein became fully independent in 1866 when the Confederation dissolved. Until the end of World War I, it was closely tied to Austria, but the economic devastation caused by that conflict forced Liechtenstein to enter into a customs and monetary union with Switzerland. Since World War II (in which Liechtenstein remained neutral), the country's low taxes have spurred outstanding economic growth. In 2000, shortcomings in banking regulatory oversight resulted in concerns about the use of financial institutions for money laundering. However, Liechtenstein implemented anti-money laundering legislation and a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty with the US that went into effect in 2003.","communications":{"country_id":"LI","fixed_phones_total":"9,000","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"less than 1 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"3.652 million","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"87 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"the limited services available are found almost exclusively in the capital, Monrovia; fixed-line service stagnant and extremely limited; telephone coverage extended to a number of other towns and rural areas by four mobile-cellular network operators","phone_system_international":"country code - 231; satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean) (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"mobile-cellular subscription base growing and teledensity reached 85 per 100 persons in 2015","broadcast_media":"3 private TV stations; satellite TV service available; 1 state-owned radio station; about 15 independent radio stations broadcasting in Monrovia, with another 25 local stations operating in other areas; transmissions of 2 international broadcasters are av (2007)","internet_country_code":"lr","internet_total_users":"248,000","internet_population_percent":"5.9","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:59","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:59"},"economy":{"country_id":"LI","overview":"Liberia is a low income country that relies heavily on foreign assistance. It is richly endowed with water, mineral resources, forests, and a climate favorable to agriculture. Its principal exports are iron ore, rubber, gold and timber. The government has attempted to revive raw timber extraction and is encouraging oil exploration. ++  ++ In the 1990s and early 2000s, civil war and government mismanagement destroyed much of Liberia's economy, especially infrastructure in and around the capital. With the conclusion of fighting and the installation of a democratically elected government in 2006, businesses that had fled the country began to return. The country achieved high growth during 2010-13 due to favorable world prices for its commodities. However, in 2014 as the Ebolavirus began to spread, the economy declined and many businesses departed, taking capital and expertise with them. The epidemic forced the government to divert scarce resources to combat the spread of the virus, reducing funds available for needed public investment. The cost of addressing the Ebola epidemic will weigh heavily on public finances at the same time decreased economic activity reduces government revenue, although higher donor support will partly offset this loss. ++  ++ Revitalizing the economy in the future will depend on increasing investment and trade, higher global commodity prices, sustained foreign aid and remittances, development of infrastructure and institutions, and maintaining political stability and security.","gdp_power_parity":"$3.881 billion (2016 est.) ++ $3.806 billion (2015 est.) ++ $3.806 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"2% (2016 est.) ++ 0% (2015 est.) ++ 0.7% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$900 (2016 est.) ++ $900 (2015 est.) ++ $900 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"134.1%","gdp_consumption":"16.3%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"19.5%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"-5.2%","gdp_exports":"25%","gdp_imports":"-94.9% (2014 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"35.4%","gdp_sector_industry":"14.4%","gdp_sector_services":"50.2% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"rubber, coffee, cocoa, rice, cassava (manioc, tapioca), palm oil, sugarcane, bananas;
