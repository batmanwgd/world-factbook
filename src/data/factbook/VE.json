{"id":"VE","iso_a3":"VEN","fips":"VE","continent":"SA","name":"Venezuela","introduction":"Venezuela was one of three countries that emerged from the collapse of Gran Colombia in 1830 (the others being Ecuador and New Granada, which became Colombia). For most of the first half of the 20th century, Venezuela was ruled by generally benevolent military strongmen, who promoted the oil industry and allowed for some social reforms. Democratically elected governments have held sway since 1959. Under Hugo CHAVEZ, president from 1999 to 2013, and his hand-picked successor, President Nicolas MADURO, the executive branch has exercised increasingly authoritarian control over other branches of government. At the same time, democratic institutions have deteriorated, threats to freedom of expression have increased, and political polarization has grown. The ruling party's economic policies have expanded the state's role in the economy through expropriations of major enterprises, strict currency exchange and price controls that discourage private sector investment and production, and overdependence on the petroleum industry for revenues, among others. Current concerns include: an increasingly politicized military, rampant violent crime, high inflation, and widespread shortages of basic consumer goods, medicine, and medical supplies.","communications":{"country_id":"VE","fixed_phones_total":"7,780,096","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"27 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"29.094 million","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"99 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"modern and expanding","phone_system_international":"country code - 58; submarine cable systems provide connectivity to Cuba and the Caribbean, Central and South America, and US; satellite earth stations - 1 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean) and 1 PanAmSat; participating with Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia in (2013)","phone_system_domestic":"2 domestic satellite systems with 3 earth stations; recent substantial improvement in telephone service in rural areas; substantial increase in digitalization of exchanges and trunk lines; installation of a national interurban fiber-optic network capable","broadcast_media":"government supervises a mixture of state-run and private broadcast media; 13 public service networks, 61 privately owned TV networks, a privately owned news channel with limited national coverage, and a government-backed Pan-American channel; state-run ra (2014)","internet_country_code":"ve","internet_total_users":"18.113 million","internet_population_percent":"61.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:01","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:01"},"economy":{"country_id":"VE","overview":"Venezuela remains highly dependent on oil revenues, which account for almost all export earnings and nearly half of the government’s revenue. The country ended 2015 with an estimated 10% contraction in its GDP, 275% inflation, widespread shortages of consumer goods, and declining central bank international reserves. The IMF forecasts that the GDP will shrink another 8% in 2016 and inflation may reach 720%. ++  ++ Falling oil prices since 2014 have aggravated Venezuela’s economic crisis. Insufficient access to dollars, price controls, and rigid labor regulations have led some US and multinational firms to reduce or shut down their Venezuelan operations. Market uncertainty and state oil company PDVSA’s poor cash flow have slowed investment in the petroleum sector, resulting in a decline in oil production. ++  ++ Under President Nicolas MADURO, the Venezuelan Government’s response to the economic crisis has been to increase state control over the economy and blame the private sector for the shortages. The Venezuelan government has maintained strict currency controls since 2003. On 17 February 2016, the Venezuelan government announced a change from three official currency exchange mechanisms to only two official rates for the sale of dollars to private sector firms and individuals, with rates based on the government's import priorities. The official exchange rate used for food and medicine imports was devalued to 10 bolivars per dollar from 6.3 bolivars per dollar. The second rate moved to a managed float. These currency controls present significant obstacles to trade with Venezuela because importers cannot obtain sufficient dollars to purchase goods needed to maintain their operations. MADURO has used decree powers to enact legislation to deepen the state’s role as the primary buyer and distributor of imports, further tighten currency controls, cap business profits, and extend price controls.","gdp_power_parity":"$468.6 billion (2016 est.) ++ $520.7 billion (2015 est.) ++ $555.2 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"-10% (2016 est.) ++ -6.2% (2015 est.) ++ -3.9% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$15,100 (2016 est.) ++ $17,000 (2015 est.) ++ $18,400 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"71.1%","gdp_consumption":"18.8%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"16.7%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"1.4%","gdp_exports":"5.6%","gdp_imports":"-13.6% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"4%","gdp_sector_industry":"36.1%","gdp_sector_services":"59.9% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"corn, sorghum, sugarcane, rice, bananas, vegetables, coffee;
