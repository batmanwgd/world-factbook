{"id":"BR","iso_a3":"BRA","fips":"BR","continent":"SA","name":"Brazil","introduction":"Following more than three centuries under Portuguese rule, Brazil gained its independence in 1822, maintaining a monarchical system of government until the abolition of slavery in 1888 and the subsequent proclamation of a republic by the military in 1889. Brazilian coffee exporters politically dominated the country until populist leader Getulio VARGAS rose to power in 1930. By far the largest and most populous country in South America, Brazil underwent more than a half century of populist and military government until 1985, when the military regime peacefully ceded power to civilian rulers. Brazil continues to pursue industrial and agricultural growth and development of its interior. Having successfully weathered a period of global financial difficulty in the late 20th century, Brazil was seen as one of the world’s strongest emerging markets and a contributor to global growth. The awarding of the 2014 FIFA World Cup and 2016 Summer Olympic Games, the first ever to be held in South America, was seen as symbolic of the country’s rise. However, since about 2013, Brazil has been plagued by a shrinking economy, growing unemployment, and rising inflation. Political scandal resulted in the impeachment of President Dilma ROUSSEFF in May 2016, a conviction that was upheld by the Senate in August 2016; her vice president, Michel TEMER, will serve as president until 2018, completing her second term.","communications":{"country_id":"BR","fixed_phones_total":"43,677,141","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"21 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"257.814 million","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"126 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"good working system including an extensive microwave radio relay system and a domestic satellite system with 64 earth stations","phone_system_international":"country code - 55; landing point for a number of submarine cables, including Americas-1, Americas-2, Atlantis-2, GlobeNet, South America-1, South American Crossing\/Latin American Nautilus, and UNISUR that provide direct connectivity to South and Central A (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"fixed-line connections have remained relatively stable in recent years and stand at about 20 per 100 persons; less-expensive mobile-cellular technology has been a major driver in expanding telephone service to the lower-income segments of the population w","broadcast_media":"state-run Radiobras operates a radio and a TV network; more than 1,000 radio stations and more than 100 TV channels operating - mostly privately owned; private media ownership highly concentrated (2007)","internet_country_code":"br","internet_total_users":"120.676 million","internet_population_percent":"59.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:57","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:57"},"economy":{"country_id":"BR","overview":"Characterized by large and well-developed agricultural, mining, manufacturing, and service sectors, and a rapidly expanding middle class, Brazil's economy outweighs that of all other South American countries, and Brazil is expanding its presence in world markets. Since 2003, Brazil has steadily improved its macroeconomic stability, building up foreign reserves, and reducing its debt profile by shifting its debt burden toward real denominated and domestically held instruments. Since 2008, Brazil became a net external creditor and all three of the major ratings agencies awarded investment grade status to its debt. ++  ++ After strong growth in 2007 and 2008, the onset of the global financial crisis hit Brazil in 2008. Brazil experienced two quarters of recession, as global demand for Brazil's commodity-based exports dwindled and external credit dried up. However, Brazil was one of the first emerging markets to begin a recovery. In 2010, consumer and investor confidence revived and GDP growth reached 7.5%, the highest growth rate in the past 25 years. GDP growth has slowed since 2011, due to several factors, including overdependence on exports of raw commodities, low productivity, high operational costs, persistently high inflation, and low levels of investment. After reaching historic lows of 4.8% in 2014, the unemployment rate remains low, but is rising. Brazil's traditionally high level of income inequality has declined for the last 15 years. ++  ++ Brazil’s fiscal and current account balances have eroded during the past four years as the government attempted to boost economic growth through targeted tax cuts for industry and incentives to spur household consumption. After winning reelection in October 2014 by a historically narrow margin, President Dilma ROUSSEFF appointed a new economic team led by Finance Minister Joaquim LEVY, who introduced a fiscal austerity package intended to restore the primary account surplus (before interest expenditures are included) to 1.2% of GDP and preserve the country's investment-grade sovereign credit rating. LEVY encountered political headwinds and an economy facing more challenges than he anticipated. The target for the primary account surplus fell to a deficit of 2%, and two of the three main credit rating agencies downgraded Brazil to “junk” status. ++  ++ Brazil seeks to strengthen its workforce and its economy over the long run by imposing local content and technology transfer requirements on foreign businesses, by investing in education through social programs such as Bolsa Familia and the Brazil Science Mobility Program, and by investing in research in the areas of space, nanotechnology, healthcare, and energy.","gdp_power_parity":"$3.135 trillion (2016 est.) ++ $3.241 trillion (2015 est.) ++ $3.371 trillion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"-3.3% (2016 est.) ++ -3.8% (2015 est.) ++ 0.1% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$15,200 (2016 est.) ++ $15,900 (2015 est.) ++ $16,600 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"62.5%","gdp_consumption":"20.6%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"15.8%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"-0.1%","gdp_exports":"13.9%","gdp_imports":"-12.7% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"6.3%","gdp_sector_industry":"21.8%","gdp_sector_services":"72% ++  (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"coffee, soybeans, wheat, rice, corn, sugarcane, cocoa, citrus;
