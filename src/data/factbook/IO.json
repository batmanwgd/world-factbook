{"id":"IO","iso_a3":"IOT","fips":"IO","continent":"AS","name":"British Indian Ocean Territory","introduction":"Formerly administered as part of the British Crown Colony of Mauritius, the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) was established as an overseas territory of the UK in 1965. A number of the islands of the territory were later transferred to the Seychelles when it attained independence in 1976. Subsequently, BIOT has consisted only of the six main island groups comprising the Chagos Archipelago. Only Diego Garcia, the largest and most southerly of the islands, is inhabited. It contains a joint UK-US naval support facility and hosts one of four dedicated ground antennas (the others are on Ascension (Saint Helena, Ascension, and Tristan da Cunha), Kwajalein (Marshall Islands), and at Cape Canaveral, Florida (US)) that assist in the operation of the Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation system. The US Air Force also operates a telescope array on Diego Garcia as part of the Ground-Based Electro-Optical Deep Space Surveillance System (GEODSS) for tracking orbital debris, which can be a hazard to spacecraft and astronauts. ++ Between 1967 and 1973, former agricultural workers, earlier residents in the islands, were relocated primarily to Mauritius, but also to the Seychelles. Negotiations between 1971 and 1982 resulted in the establishment of a trust fund by the British Government as compensation for the displaced islanders, known as Chagossians. Beginning in 1998, the islanders pursued a series of lawsuits against the British Government seeking further compensation and the right to return to the territory. In 2006 and 2007, British court rulings invalidated the immigration policies contained in the 2004 BIOT Constitution Order that had excluded the islanders from the archipelago, but upheld the special military status of Diego Garcia. In 2008, the House of Lords, as the final court of appeal in the UK, ruled in favor of the British Government by overturning the lower court rulings and finding no right of return for the Chagossians.","communications":{"country_id":"IO","fixed_phones_total":"","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"","mobile_phones_total":"","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"","phone_system_general_assessment":"separate facilities for military and public needs are available","phone_system_international":"country code (Diego Garcia) - 246; international telephone service is carried by satellite (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"all commercial telephone services are available, including connection to the Internet","broadcast_media":"Armed Forces Radio and Television Service (AFRTS) broadcasts over 3 separate frequencies for US and UK military personnel stationed on the islands (2009)","internet_country_code":"io","internet_total_users":"","internet_population_percent":"0.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:59","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:59"},"economy":{"country_id":"IO","overview":"All economic activity is concentrated on the largest island of Diego Garcia, where a joint UK-US military facility is located. Construction projects and various services needed to support the military installation are performed by military and contract employees from the UK, Mauritius, the Philippines, and the US. Some of the natural resources found in this territory include coconuts, fish, and sugarcane. Sugarcane is still a major export for this territory. There are no industrial or agricultural activities on the islands. The territory earns foreign exchange by selling fishing licenses and postage stamps.","gdp_power_parity":"","gdp_real_growth":"","gdp_per_capita":"","gdp_household_consumption":"","gdp_consumption":"","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"","gdp_exports":"","gdp_imports":"","gdp_sector_agriculture":"","gdp_sector_industry":"","gdp_sector_services":"","agriculture_products":"","industries":"","industrial_growth_rate":"","labor_force":"","labor_force_notes":"","labor_force_services":"","labor_force_industry":"","labor_force_agriculture":"","labor_force_occupation_notes":"","unemployment_rate":"","population_below_poverty":"","household_income_lowest_10":"","household_income_highest_10":"","budget_revenues":"","taxes_revenues":"","budget_net":"","public_debt":"","external_debt":"","fiscal_year":"","inflation_rate":"","central_bank_discount_rate":"","commercial_bank_prime_lending_rate":"","stock_money_narrow":"","stock_money_broad":"","stock_domestic_credit":"","exports":"","exports_commodities":"","exports_partners":"","imports":"","imports_commodities":"","imports_partners":"","exchange_rates":"the US dollar is used","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:59","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:59"},"energy":null,"geography":{"country_id":"IO","location_description":"archipelago in the Indian Ocean, south of India, about halfway between Africa and Indonesia","latitude":"-6.3431940","longitude":"71.8765190","mapReferences":"Political Map of the World","area_sqkm_total":60,"area_sqkm_land":60,"area_sqkm_water":54,"area_km_coastline":698,"area_note":"land area is about one-third the size of Washington, DC","climate":"tropical marine;
