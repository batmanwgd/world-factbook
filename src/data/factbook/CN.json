After World War II, the communists under MAO Zedong established an autocratic socialist system that, while ensuring China's sovereignty, imposed strict controls over everyday life and cost the lives of tens of millions of people. After 1978, MAO's successor DENG Xiaoping and other leaders focused on market-oriented economic development and by 2000 output had quadrupled. For much of the population, living standards have improved dramatically and the room for personal choice has expanded, yet political controls remain tight. Since the early 1990s, China has increased its global outreach and participation in international organizations.","communications":{"country_id":"CN","fixed_phones_total":"24,000","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"3 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"422,000","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"54 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"sparse system of microwave radio relay and HF radiotelephone communication stations","phone_system_international":"country code - 269; landing point for the EASSy fiber-optic submarine cable system connecting East Africa with Europe and North America; HF radiotelephone communications to Madagascar and Reunion (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"fixed-line connections only about 3 per 100 persons; mobile cellular usage over 50 per 100 persons","broadcast_media":"national state-owned TV station and a TV station run by Anjouan regional government; national state-owned radio; regional governments on the islands of Grande Comore and Anjouan each operate a radio station; a few independent and small community radio sta (2007)","internet_country_code":"km","internet_total_users":"58,000","internet_population_percent":"7.5","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58"},"economy":{"country_id":"CN","overview":"One of the world's poorest countries, Comoros is made up of three islands that are hampered by inadequate transportation links, a young and rapidly increasing population, and few natural resources. The low educational level of the labor force contributes to a subsistence level of economic activity and a heavy dependence on foreign grants and technical assistance. Agriculture, including fishing, hunting, and forestry, accounts for 50% of GDP, employs 80% of the labor force, and provides most of the exports. Export income is heavily reliant on the three main crops of vanilla, cloves, and ylang-ylang; and Comoros' export earnings are easily disrupted by disasters such as fires and extreme weather. Despite agriculture’s importance to the economy, the country imports roughly 70% of its food; rice, the main staple, accounts for the bulk of imports. ++  ++ Authorities are negotiating with the IMF for triennial program assistance. The government - which is racked by internal political disputes - is struggling to provide basic services, upgrade education and technical training, privatize commercial and industrial enterprises, improve health services, diversify exports, promote tourism, and reduce the high population growth rate. Recurring political instability, sometimes initiated from outside the country, has inhibited growth. Remittances from about 200,000 Comorans contribute about 25% of the country’s GDP. In December 2012, IMF and the World Bank's International Development Association supported $176 million in debt relief for Comoros, resulting in a 59% reduction of its future external debt service over a period of 40 years. In late 2013, a US-based investment company invested $200 million in a project to explore for hydrocarbons in Comoran territorial waters, the largest financial investment in the country’s history.","gdp_power_parity":"$1.259 billion (2016 est.) ++ $1.232 billion (2015 est.) ++ $1.22 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"2.2% (2016 est.) ++ 1% (2015 est.) ++ 2% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$1,500 (2016 est.) ++ $1,500 (2015 est.) ++ $1,600 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"104.9%","gdp_consumption":"19.2%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"11.2%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"10.3%","gdp_exports":"19.4%","gdp_imports":"-65% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"50%","gdp_sector_industry":"12.1%","gdp_sector_services":"37.9% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"vanilla, cloves, ylang-ylang (perfume essence), coconuts, bananas, cassava (manioc)","industries":"fishing, tourism, perfume distillation","industrial_growth_rate":"0.5% (2016 est.)","labor_force":"245,200 (2013 est.)","labor_force_notes":"","labor_force_services":"","labor_force_industry":"","labor_force_agriculture":"80%","labor_force_occupation_notes":"","unemployment_rate":"6.5% (2014 est.)","population_below_poverty":"44.8% (2004 est.)","household_income_lowest_10":"0.9%","household_income_highest_10":"55.2% (2004)","budget_revenues":"","taxes_revenues":"26.5% of GDP (2016 est.)","budget_net":"-3.3% of GDP (2016 est.)","public_debt":"","external_debt":"$133.3 million (31 December 2016 est.) ++ $132.8 million (31 December 2015 est.)","fiscal_year":"calendar year","inflation_rate":"1.2% (2016 est.) ++ 1.3% (2015 est.)","central_bank_discount_rate":"1.93% (31 December 2010) ++ 2.21% (31 December 2009)","commercial_bank_prime_lending_rate":"10.5% (31 December 2016 est.) ++ 10.5% (31 December 2015 est.)","stock_money_narrow":"$201.8 million (31 December 2016 est.) ++ $169 million (31 December 2015 est.)","stock_money_broad":"$303 million (31 December 2016 est.) ++ $251.7 million (31 December 2015 est.)","stock_domestic_credit":"$180.1 million (31 December 2016 est.) ++ $142.4 million (31 December 2015 est.)","exports":"$19.2 million (2016 est.) ++ $18.9 million (2015 est.)","exports_commodities":"vanilla, ylang-ylang (perfume essence), cloves","exports_partners":"India 28.7%, France 17%, Germany 8.7%, Saudi Arabia 7.1%, Singapore 6.6%, Netherlands 6.1%, Mauritius 5.3% (2015)","imports":"$191.2 million (2016 est.) ++ $195.9 million (2015 est.)","imports_commodities":"rice and other foodstuffs, consumer goods, petroleum products, cement and construction materials, transport equipment","imports_partners":"China 18.9%, Pakistan 16.2%, France 14.7%, UAE 11.3%, India 6.3% (2015)","exchange_rates":"Comoran francs (KMF) per US dollar - ++ 449.1 (2016 est.) ++ 443.6 (2015 est.) ++ 443.6 (2014 est.) ++ 370.81 (2013 est.) ++ 382.9 (2012 est.)","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58"},"energy":{"country_id":"CN","electricity_production":"44 million kWh (2014 est.)","electricity_consumption":"40.92 million kWh (2014 est.)","electricity_exports":"0 kWh (2013 est.)","electricity_imports":"0 kWh (2013 est.)","electricity_generating_capacity":"22,000 kW (2014 est.)","electricity_fossil_fuels":"95.5% of total installed capacity (2012 est.)","electricity_nuclear":"0% of total installed capacity (2012 est.)","electricity_hydroelectric":"4.5% of total installed capacity (2012 est.)","electricity_renewable":"0% of total installed capacity (2012 est.)","crude_oil_production":"0 bbl\/day (2015 est.)","crude_oil_exports":"0 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","crude_oil_imports":"0 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","crude_oil_reserves":"0 bbl (1 January 2016 es)","petrol_production":"0 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","petrol_consumption":"1,300 bbl\/day (2014 est.)","petrol_exports":"0 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","petrol_imports":"1,350 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","natural_gas_production":"0 cu m (2013 est.)","natural_gas_consumption":"0 cu m (2013 est.)","natural_gas_exports":"0 cu m (2013 est.)","natural_gas_imports":"0 cu m (2013 est.)","natural_gas_reserves":"0 cu m (1 January 2014 es)","co2_output":"200,000 Mt (2013 est.)","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58"},"geography":{"country_id":"CN","location_description":"Southern Africa, group of islands at the northern mouth of the Mozambique Channel, about two-thirds of the way between northern Madagascar and northern Mozambique","latitude":"35.8616600","longitude":"104.1953970","mapReferences":"Africa","area_sqkm_total":2,"area_sqkm_land":2,"area_sqkm_water":0,"area_km_coastline":340,"area_note":"slightly more than 12 times the size of Washington, DC","climate":"tropical marine;
