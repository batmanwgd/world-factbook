{"id":"BT","iso_a3":"BTN","fips":"BT","continent":"AS","name":"Bhutan","introduction":"Following Britain’s victory in the 1865 Duar War, Britain and Bhutan signed the Treaty of Sinchulu, under which Bhutan would receive an annual subsidy in exchange for ceding land to British India. Ugyen WANGCHUCK - who had served as the de facto ruler of an increasingly unified Bhutan and had improved relations with the British toward the end of the 19th century - was named king in 1907. Three years later, a treaty was signed whereby the British agreed not to interfere in Bhutanese internal affairs, and Bhutan allowed Britain to direct its foreign affairs. Bhutan negotiated a similar arrangement with independent India after 1947. Two years later, a formal Indo-Bhutanese accord returned to Bhutan a small piece of the territory annexed by the British, formalized the annual subsidies the country received, and defined India's responsibilities in defense and foreign relations. Under a succession of modernizing monarchs beginning in the 1950s, Bhutan joined the UN in 1971 and slowly continued its engagement beyond its borders. ++ In March 2005, King Jigme Singye WANGCHUCK unveiled the government's draft constitution - which introduced major democratic reforms - and held a national referendum for its approval. In December 2006, the King abdicated the throne in favor of his son, Jigme Khesar Namgyel WANGCHUCK. In early 2007, India and Bhutan renegotiated their treaty, eliminating the clause that stated that Bhutan would be \"guided by\" India in conducting its foreign policy, although Thimphu continues to coordinate closely with New Delhi. Elections for seating the country's first parliament were completed in March 2008; the king ratified the country's first constitution in July 2008. Bhutan experienced a peaceful turnover of power following parliamentary elections in 2013, which resulted in the defeat of the incumbent party. The disposition of some 18,000 refugees of the roughly 100,000 who fled or were forced out of Bhutan in the 1990s - and who are housed in two UN refugee camps in Nepal - remains unresolved.","communications":{"country_id":"BT","fixed_phones_total":"21,811","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"3 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"676,000","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"91 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"urban towns and district headquarters have telecommunications services","phone_system_international":"country code - 975; international telephone and telegraph service via landline and microwave relay through India; satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"domestic service inadequate, especially in rural areas; mobile-cellular service, begun in 2003, is now widely available","broadcast_media":"state-owned TV station established in 1999; cable TV service offers dozens of Indian and other international channels; first radio station, privately launched in 1973, is now state-owned; 5 private radio stations are currently broadcasting (2012)","internet_country_code":"bt","internet_total_users":"295,000","internet_population_percent":"39.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58"},"economy":{"country_id":"BT","overview":"Bhutan's economy, small and less developed, is based largely on hydropower, agriculture, and forestry, which provide the main livelihood for more than half of the population. Because rugged mountains dominate the terrain and make the building of roads and other infrastructure difficult and expensive, industrial production is primarily of the cottage industry type. The economy is closely aligned with India's through strong trade and monetary links and is dependent on India for financial assistance and migrant laborers for development projects, especially for road construction. Bhutan inked a pact in December 2014 to expand duty-free trade with Bangladesh, the only trade partner with which Bhutan enjoys a surplus. ++  ++ Multilateral development organizations administer most educational, social, and environment programs, and take into account the government's desire to protect the country's environment and cultural traditions. For example, the government, in its cautious expansion of the tourist sector, encourages visits by upscale, environmentally conscientious tourists. Complicated controls and uncertain policies in areas such as industrial licensing, trade, labor, and finance continue to hamper foreign investment. ++  ++ Bhutan’s largest export - hydropower to India - could spur sustainable growth in the coming years if Bhutan resolves chronic delays in construction. Bhutan currently taps only 5% of its 30,000-megawatt hydropower potential and is behind schedule in building 12 new hydropower dams with a combined capacity of 10,000 megawatts by 2020 in accordance with a deal signed in 2008 with India. The high volume of imported materials to build hydropower plants has expanded Bhutan's trade and current account deficits. However, Bhutan and India in April 2014 agreed to begin four additional hydropower projects, which would generate 2,120 megawatts in total. Bhutan also is exploring energy exports to Bangladesh.","gdp_power_parity":"$6.432 billion (2016 est.) ++ $6.066 billion (2015 est.) ++ $5.766 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"6% (2016 est.) ++ 5.2% (2015 est.) ++ 3.8% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$8,100 (2016 est.) ++ $7,800 (2015 est.) ++ $7,500 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"53.4%","gdp_consumption":"18.7%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"64.3%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"0%","gdp_exports":"42.4%","gdp_imports":"-78.8% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"16.4%","gdp_sector_industry":"42.1%","gdp_sector_services":"41.5% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"rice, corn, root crops, citrus;
