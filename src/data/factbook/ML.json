{"id":"ML","iso_a3":"MLI","fips":"ML","continent":"AF","name":"Mali","introduction":"The Sudanese Republic and Senegal became independent of France in 1960 as the Mali Federation. When Senegal withdrew after only a few months, what formerly made up the Sudanese Republic was renamed Mali. Rule by dictatorship was brought to a close in 1991 by a military coup that ushered in a period of democratic rule. President Alpha KONARE won Mali's first two democratic presidential elections in 1992 and 1997. In keeping with Mali's two-term constitutional limit, he stepped down in 2002 and was succeeded by Amadou Toumani TOURE, who was elected to a second term in a 2007 election that was widely judged to be free and fair. Malian returnees from Libya in 2011 exacerbated tensions in northern Mali, and Tuareg ethnic militias rebelled in January 2012. Low- and mid-level soldiers, frustrated with the poor handling of the rebellion, overthrew TOURE on 22 March. Intensive mediation efforts led by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) returned power to a civilian administration in April with the appointment of Interim President Dioncounda TRAORE. The post-coup chaos led to rebels expelling the Malian military from the country's three northern regions and allowed Islamic militants to set up strongholds. Hundreds of thousands of northern Malians fled the violence to southern Mali and neighboring countries, exacerbating regional food shortages in host communities. An international military intervention to retake the three northern regions began in January 2013 and within a month most of the north had been retaken. In a democratic presidential election conducted in July and August of 2013, Ibrahim Boubacar KEITA was elected president. The Malian Government and northern armed groups signed an internationally-mediated peace accord in June 2015.","communications":{"country_id":"ML","fixed_phones_total":"169,006","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"1 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"22.699 million","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"134 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"domestic system improving; increasing use of local radio loops to extend network coverage to remote areas","phone_system_international":"country code - 223; satellite communications center and fiber-optic links to neighboring countries; satellite earth stations - 2 Intelsat (1 Atlantic Ocean, 1 Indian Ocean) (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"fixed-line subscribership remains less than 1 per 100 persons; mobile-cellular subscribership has increased sharply to over 130 per 100 persons","broadcast_media":"national public TV broadcaster; 2 privately owned companies provide subscription services to foreign multi-channel TV packages; national public radio broadcaster supplemented by a large number of privately owned and community broadcast stations; transmiss (2007)","internet_country_code":"ml","internet_total_users":"1.753 million","internet_population_percent":"10.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:59","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:59"},"economy":{"country_id":"ML","overview":"Among the 25 poorest countries in the world, Mali is a landlocked country that depends on gold mining and agricultural exports for revenue. The country's fiscal status fluctuates with gold and agricultural commodity prices and the harvest; cotton and gold exports make up around 80% of export earnings. Mali remains dependent on foreign aid. ++  ++ Economic activity is largely confined to the riverine area irrigated by the Niger River and about 65% of its land area is desert or semidesert. About 10% of the population is nomadic and about 80% of the labor force is engaged in farming and fishing. Industrial activity is concentrated on processing farm commodities. The government subsidizes the production of cereals to decrease the country’s dependence on imported foodstuffs and to reduce its vulnerability to food price shocks. ++  ++ Mali is developing its iron ore extraction industry to diversify foreign exchange earnings away from gold, but the pace will largely depend on global price trends. Mali’s economic performance has improved since 2013 although physical insecurity, high population growth, corruption, weak infrastructure, and low levels of human capital remain hindrances to sustained growth.","gdp_power_parity":"$38.09 billion (2016 est.) ++ $36.16 billion (2015 est.) ++ $34.13 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"5.3% (2016 est.) ++ 6% (2015 est.) ++ 7% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$2,300 (2016 est.) ++ $2,200 (2015 est.) ++ $2,200 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"71.1%","gdp_consumption":"17.6%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"17.3%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"0.1%","gdp_exports":"23.5%","gdp_imports":"-29.6% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"41%","gdp_sector_industry":"18.6%","gdp_sector_services":"40.4% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"cotton, millet, rice, corn, vegetables, peanuts;
