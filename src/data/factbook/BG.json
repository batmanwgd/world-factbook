Although more than half of GDP is generated through the services sector, almost half of Bangladeshis are employed in the agriculture sector, with rice as the single-most-important product. ++  ++ Garment exports, the backbone of Bangladesh's industrial sector, accounted for more than 80% of total exports and surpassed $25 billion in 2015. The sector continues to grow, despite a series of factory accidents that have killed more than 1,000 workers, and crippling strikes, including a nationwide transportation blockade implemented by the political opposition during the first several months of 2015. Steady garment export growth combined with remittances from overseas Bangladeshis - which totaled about $15 billion and 8% of GDP in 2015 - are the largest contributors to Bangladesh's sustained economic growth and rising foreign exchange reserves.","gdp_power_parity":"$628.4 billion (2016 est.) ++ $587.7 billion (2015 est.) ++ $550.2 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"6.9% (2016 est.) ++ 6.8% (2015 est.) ++ 6.3% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$3,900 (2016 est.) ++ $3,700 (2015 est.) ++ $3,500 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"70.3%","gdp_consumption":"5.2%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"28.2%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"3%","gdp_exports":"16.5%","gdp_imports":"-23.2% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"15.1%","gdp_sector_industry":"28.6%","gdp_sector_services":"56.3% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"rice, jute, tea, wheat, sugarcane, potatoes, tobacco, pulses, oilseeds, spices, fruit;
