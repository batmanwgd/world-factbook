The Basuto National Party ruled the country during its first two decades. King MOSHOESHOE was exiled in 1990, but returned to Lesotho in 1992 and was reinstated in 1995 and subsequently succeeded by his son, King LETSIE III, in 1996. Constitutional government was restored in 1993 after seven years of military rule. In 1998, violent protests and a military mutiny following a contentious election prompted a brief but bloody intervention by South African and Batswana military forces under the aegis of the Southern African Development Community. Subsequent constitutional reforms restored relative political stability. Peaceful parliamentary elections were held in 2002, but the National Assembly elections of February 2007 were hotly contested and aggrieved parties disputed how the electoral law was applied to award proportional seats in the Assembly. In May 2012, competitive elections involving 18 parties saw Prime Minister Motsoahae Thomas THABANE form a coalition government - the first in the country's history - that ousted the 14-year incumbent, Pakalitha MOSISILI, who peacefully transferred power the following month. MOSISILI returned to power in snap elections in February 2015 after the collapse of THABANEâ€™s coalition government and an alleged attempted military coup.","communications":{"country_id":"LS","fixed_phones_total":"17,184","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"46 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"41,000","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"108 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"automatic telephone system","phone_system_international":"country code - 423; linked to Swiss networks by cable and microwave radio relay (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"fixed-line and mobile-cellular services widely available; combined telephone service subscribership exceeds 150 per 100 persons","broadcast_media":"relies on foreign terrestrial and satellite broadcasters for most broadcast media services; first Liechtenstein-based TV station established August 2008; Radio Liechtenstein operates multiple radio stations; a Swiss-based broadcaster operates several radi (2008)","internet_country_code":"li","internet_total_users":"36,000","internet_population_percent":"96.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:59","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:59"},"economy":{"country_id":"LS","overview":"Despite its small size and lack of natural resources, Liechtenstein has developed into a prosperous, highly industrialized, free-enterprise economy with a vital financial service sector and the third highest per capita income in the world, after Qatar and Luxembourg. The Liechtenstein economy is widely diversified with a large number of small businesses. Low business taxes - the maximum tax rate is 20% - and easy incorporation rules have induced many holding companies to establish nominal offices in Liechtenstein, providing 30% of state revenues. ++  ++ The country participates in a customs union with Switzerland and uses the Swiss franc as its national currency. It imports more than 90% of its energy requirements. Liechtenstein has been a member of the European Economic Area (an organization serving as a bridge between the European Free Trade Association and the EU) since May 1995. The government is working to harmonize its economic policies with those of an integrated Europe. ++  ++ Since 2008, Liechtenstein has faced renewed international pressure - particularly from Germany and the US - to improve transparency in its banking and tax systems. In December 2008, Liechtenstein signed a Tax Information Exchange Agreement with the US. Upon Liechtenstein's conclusion of 12 bilateral information-sharing agreements, the OECD in October 2009 removed the principality from its \"grey list\" of countries that had yet to implement the organization's Model Tax Convention. By the end of 2010, Liechtenstein had signed 25 Tax Information Exchange Agreements or Double Tax Agreements. In 2011, Liechtenstein joined the Schengen area, which allows passport-free travel across 26 European countries.","gdp_power_parity":"$3.2 billion (2009 est.) ++ $3.216 billion (2008 est.) ++ $3.159 billion (2007 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"1.8% (2012 est.) ++ -0.5% (2009 est.) ++ 3.1% (2007 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$89,400 (2009 est.) ++ $90,600 (2008 est.) ++ $89,700 (2007 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"","gdp_consumption":"","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"","gdp_exports":"","gdp_imports":"","gdp_sector_agriculture":"8%","gdp_sector_industry":"37%","gdp_sector_services":"55% (2009)","agriculture_products":"wheat, barley, corn, potatoes;
