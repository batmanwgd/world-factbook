Fighting between the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), led by Jose Eduardo DOS SANTOS, and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), led by Jonas SAVIMBI, followed independence from Portugal in 1975. Peace seemed imminent in 1992 when Angola held national elections, but fighting picked up again in 1993. Up to 1.5 million lives may have been lost - and 4 million people displaced - during the more than a quarter century of fighting. SAVIMBI's death in 2002 ended UNITA's insurgency and cemented the MPLA's hold on power. President DOS SANTOS pushed through a new constitution in 2010 and elections held in 2012 saw him installed as president. Angola assumed a nonpermanent seat on the UN Security Council for the 2015-16 term.","communications":{"country_id":"AO","fixed_phones_total":"284,925","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"1 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"13.885 million","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"71 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"limited system; state-owned telecom had monopoly for fixed lines until 2005; demand outstripped capacity, prices were high, and services poor; Telecom Namibia, through an Angolan company, became the first private licensed operator in Angola's fixed-line t","phone_system_international":"country code - 244; landing point for the SAT-3\/WASC fiber-optic submarine cable that provides connectivity to Europe and Asia; satellite earth stations - 29 (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"only about one fixed line per 100 persons; mobile-cellular teledensity about 71 telephones per 100 persons in 2015","broadcast_media":"state controls all broadcast media with nationwide reach; state-owned Televisao Popular de Angola (TPA) provides terrestrial TV service on 2 channels; a third TPA channel is available via cable and satellite; TV subscription services are available; state- (2008)","internet_country_code":"ao","internet_total_users":"2.434 million","internet_population_percent":"12.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:57","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:57"},"economy":{"country_id":"AO","overview":"Angola's economy is overwhelmingly driven by its oil sector. Oil production and its supporting activities contribute about 50% of GDP, more than 70% of government revenue, and more than 90% of the country's exports. Diamonds contribute an additional 5% to exports. Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for most of the people, but half of the country's food is still imported. Increased oil production supported growth averaging more than 17% per year from 2004 to 2008. A postwar reconstruction boom and resettlement of displaced persons has led to high rates of growth in construction and agriculture as well. Some of the country's infrastructure is still damaged or undeveloped from the 27-year-long civil war. However, the government since 2005 has used billions of dollars in credit lines from China, Brazil, Portugal, Germany, Spain, and the EU to help rebuild Angola's public infrastructure. Land mines left from the war still mar the countryside, and as a result, the national military, international partners, and private Angolan firms all continue to remove them. The global recession that started in 2008 stalled economic growth. In particular, lower prices for oil and diamonds during the global recession slowed GDP growth to 2.4% in 2009, and many construction projects stopped because Luanda accrued $9 billion in arrears to foreign construction companies when government revenue fell in 2008 and 2009. Angola formally abandoned its currency peg in 2009, and in November 2009 signed onto an IMF Stand-By Arrangement loan of $1.4 billion to rebuild international reserves. Consumer inflation declined from 325% in 2000 to less than 9% in 2014. Falling oil prices and slower than expected growth in non-oil GDP have reduced growth prospects for 2015. Angola has responded by reducing government subsidies and by proposing import quotas and a more restrictive licensing regime. Corruption, especially in the extractive sectors, is a major long-term challenge.","gdp_power_parity":"$187.3 billion (2016 est.) ++ $187.3 billion (2015 est.) ++ $181.8 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"0% (2016 est.) ++ 3% (2015 est.) ++ 4.8% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$6,800 (2016 est.) ++ $7,000 (2015 est.) ++ $7,000 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"72.5%","gdp_consumption":"18.1%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"10.3%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"0%","gdp_exports":"35.3%","gdp_imports":"-36.2% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"10.2%","gdp_sector_industry":"61.4%","gdp_sector_services":"28.4% (2011 est.)","agriculture_products":"bananas, sugarcane, coffee, sisal, corn, cotton, cassava (manioc, tapioca), tobacco, vegetables, plantains;
