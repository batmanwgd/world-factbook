{"id":"BD","iso_a3":"BGD","fips":"BG","continent":"AS","name":"Bangladesh","introduction":"Muslim conversions and settlement in the region now referred to as Bangladesh began in the 10th century, primarily from Arab and Persian traders and preachers. Europeans established trading posts in the area in the 16th century. Eventually the area known as Bengal, primarily Hindu in the western section and mostly Muslim in the eastern half, became part of British India. Partition in 1947 resulted in an eastern wing of Pakistan in the Muslim-majority area, which became East Pakistan. Calls for greater autonomy and animosity between the eastern and western wings of Pakistan led to a Bengali independence movement. That movement, led by the Awami League (AL) and supported by India, won the independence war for Bangladesh in 1971, during which at least 300,000 civilians died. ++ The post-independence AL government faced daunting challenges and in 1975 was overthrown by the military, triggering a series of military coups that resulted in a military-backed government and subsequent creation of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) in 1978. That government also ended in a coup in 1981, followed by military-backed rule until democratic elections occurred in 1991. The BNP and AL alternated in power between 1991 and 2013, with the exception of a military-backed, emergency caretaker regime that suspended parliamentary elections planned for January 2007 in an effort to reform the political system and root out corruption. That government returned the country to fully democratic rule in December 2008 with the election of the AL and Prime Minister Sheikh HASINA. In January 2014, the incumbent AL won the national election by an overwhelming majority after the BNP boycotted, extending HASINA's term as prime minister. With the help of international development assistance, Bangladesh has reduced the poverty rate from over half of the population to less than a third, achieved Millennium Development Goals for maternal and child health, and made great progress in food security since independence. The economy has grown at an annual average of about 6% over the last two decades and the country reached World Bank lower-middle income status in 2015.","communications":{"country_id":"BD","fixed_phones_total":"29,200","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"42 (July 2014 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"59,500","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"85 (July 2014 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"a good, fully automatic digital telephone system with fiber-optic trunk lines","phone_system_international":"country code - 1-441; landing points for the GlobeNet, Gemini Bermuda, CBUS, and the Challenger Bermuda-1 (CB-1) submarine cables; satellite earth stations - 3 (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"the system has a high fixed-line teledensity coupled with a mobile-cellular teledensity of roughly 125 per 100 persons","broadcast_media":"3 TV stations; cable and satellite TV subscription services are available; roughly 13 radio stations operating (2012)","internet_country_code":"bm","internet_total_users":"69,000","internet_population_percent":"98.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:57","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:57"},"economy":{"country_id":"BD","overview":"Tourism accounts for about 5% of Bermuda's GDP, but a much larger share of employment. Over 80% of its visitors come from the US. The sector struggled in the wake of the global recession of 2008-09. International business, which consists primarily of reinsurance and other financial services, is the real bedrock of Bermuda's economy, consistently accounting for about 85% of the island's GDP. Even this sector, however, has lost roughly 5,000 high-paying expatriate jobs since 2008, weighing heavily on household consumption and retail sales. Bermuda must import almost everything. Agriculture and industry are limited due to the small size of the island. ++  ++ Bermuda's economy entered its seventh straight year of recession in 2015. Unemployment is 9%, public debt is growing and exceeds $2.3 billion, the government pension fund faces a $2.4 billion shortfall, and the economy has not attracted significant amounts of new foreign investment. Bermuda's FY 2015-16 budget projects a 12% larger deficit than FY14\/15. The government announced it would borrow $125 million in 2015 to meet current operating expenses. Still, Bermuda enjoys the fourth highest per capita income in the world, about 70% higher than that of the US.","gdp_power_parity":"$5.198 billion (2013 est.) ++ $5.331 billion (2012 est.) ++ $5.6 billion (2011 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"-2.5% (2013 est.) ++ -4.8% (2012) ++ -3.5% (2011 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$85,700 (2013 est.) ++ $85,400 (2012 est.) ++ $86,000 (2011 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"53.4%","gdp_consumption":"15.3%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"10.9%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"-0.1%","gdp_exports":"41.8%","gdp_imports":"-21.3% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"0.7%","gdp_sector_industry":"5.8%","gdp_sector_services":"93.4% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"bananas, vegetables, citrus, flowers;
