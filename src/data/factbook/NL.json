After a 20-year French occupation, a Kingdom of the Netherlands was formed in 1815. In 1830, Belgium seceded and formed a separate kingdom. The Netherlands remained neutral in World War I, but suffered German invasion and occupation in World War II. A modern, industrialized nation, the Netherlands is also a large exporter of agricultural products. The country was a founding member of NATO and the EEC (now the EU) and participated in the introduction of the euro in 1999. In October 2010, the former Netherlands Antilles was dissolved and the three smallest islands - Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba - became special municipalities in the Netherlands administrative structure. The larger islands of Sint Maarten and Curacao joined the Netherlands and Aruba as constituent countries forming the Kingdom of the Netherlands.","communications":{"country_id":"NL","fixed_phones_total":"6,951,528","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"41 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"20.809 million","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"123 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"highly developed and well maintained","phone_system_international":"country code - 31; submarine cables provide links to the US and Europe; satellite earth stations - 5 (3 Intelsat - 1 Indian Ocean and 2 Atlantic Ocean, 1 Eutelsat, and 1 Inmarsat (2011)","phone_system_domestic":"extensive fixed-line, fiber-optic network; large cellular telephone system with 5 major operators utilizing the third generation of the Global System for Mobile Communications technology; one in five households now use Voice over the Internet Protocol ser","broadcast_media":"more than 90% of households are connected to cable or satellite TV systems that provide a wide range of domestic and foreign channels; public service broadcast system includes multiple broadcasters, 3 with a national reach and the remainder operating in r (2008)","internet_country_code":"nl","internet_total_users":"15.778 million","internet_population_percent":"93.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:00","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:00"},"economy":{"country_id":"NL","overview":"The Netherlands, the sixth-largest economy in the European Union, plays an important role as a European transportation hub, with a persistently high trade surplus, stable industrial relations, and moderate unemployment. Industry focuses on food processing, chemicals, petroleum refining, and electrical machinery. A highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2% of the labor force but provides large surpluses for food-processing and underpins the country’s status as the world’s second largest agricultural exporter. ++  ++ The Netherlands is part of the euro zone, and as such, its monetary policy is controlled by the European Central Bank. The Dutch financial sector is highly concentrated, with four commercial banks possessing over 90% of banking assets. The sector suffered as a result of the global financial crisis and required billions of dollars of government support, but the European Banking Authority completed stringent reviews in 2014 and deemed Dutch banks to be well-capitalized. To address the 2009 and 2010 economic downturns, the government sought to stimulate the domestic economy by accelerating infrastructure programs, offering corporate tax breaks for employers to retain workers, and expanding export credits. The stimulus programs and bank bailouts, however, resulted in a government budget deficit of 5.3% of GDP in 2010 that contrasted sharply with a surplus of 0.7% in 2008. ++  ++ The government of Prime Minister Mark RUTTE has since implemented significant austerity measures to improve public finances and has instituted broad structural reforms in key policy areas, including the labor market, the housing sector, the energy market, and the pension system. As a result, the government budget deficit at the end of 2015 dropped to 2% of GDP. Following a protracted recession during which unemployment doubled to 7.4% and household consumption contracted for nearly three consecutive years, 2014 saw fragile GDP growth of 1% and a rise in most economic indicators. Growth picked up in 2015 as households boosted purchases through reduced saving. Drivers of growth included increased exports and business investments, as well as newly invigorated household consumption.","gdp_power_parity":"$865.9 billion (2016 est.) ++ $851.5 billion (2015 est.) ++ $835.2 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"1.7% (2016 est.) ++ 2% (2015 est.) ++ 1.4% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$50,800 (2016 est.) ++ $50,300 (2015 est.) ++ $49,500 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"44.4%","gdp_consumption":"24.9%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"20.3%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"-0.2%","gdp_exports":"81.6%","gdp_imports":"-71% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"1.6%","gdp_sector_industry":"17.8%","gdp_sector_services":"70.4% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"grains, potatoes, sugar beets, fruits, vegetables;
