The country prospered in the past half century as a modern, technologically advanced European state and member of NATO and the EU. Political divisions between the Dutch-speaking Flemish of the north and the French-speaking Walloons of the south have led in recent years to constitutional amendments granting these regions formal recognition and autonomy. Its capital, Brussels, is home to numerous international organizations including the EU and NATO.","communications":{"country_id":"BE","fixed_phones_total":"4,488,711","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"40 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"12.938 million","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"114 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"highly developed, technologically advanced, and completely automated domestic and international telephone and telegraph facilities","phone_system_international":"country code - 32; landing point for a number of submarine cables that provide links to Europe, the Middle East, and Asia; satellite earth stations - 7 (Intelsat - 3) (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"nationwide mobile-cellular telephone system; extensive cable network; limited microwave radio relay network","broadcast_media":"a segmented market with the three major communities (Flemish, French, and German-speaking) each having responsibility for their own broadcast media; multiple TV channels exist for each community; additionally, in excess of 90% of households are connected (2007)","internet_country_code":"be","internet_total_users":"9.631 million","internet_population_percent":"85.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:57","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:57"},"economy":{"country_id":"BE","overview":"This modern, open, and private-enterprise-based economy has capitalized on its central geographic location, highly developed transport network, and diversified industrial and commercial base. Industry is concentrated mainly in the more heavily-populated region of Flanders in the north. With few natural resources, Belgium imports substantial quantities of raw materials and exports a large volume of manufactures, making its economy vulnerable to shifts in foreign demand, particularly with Belgium’s EU trade partners. Roughly three-quarters of Belgium's trade is with other EU countries. ++  ++ In 2015, Belgian GDP grew by 1.4%, the unemployment rate stabilized at 8.6%, and the budget deficit was 2.7% of GDP. Prime Minister Charles MICHEL's center-right government has pledged to further reduce the deficit in response to EU pressure to reduce Belgium's high public debt, which remains above 100% of GDP, but such efforts could also dampen economic growth. In addition to restrained public spending, low wage growth and high unemployment promise to curtail a more robust recovery in private consumption. ++  ++ The government has pledged to pursue a reform program to improve Belgium’s competitiveness, including changes to tax policy, labor market rules, and welfare benefits. These changes risk worsening tensions with trade unions and triggering extended strikes.","gdp_power_parity":"$508.6 billion (2016 est.) ++ $501.4 billion (2015 est.) ++ $494.6 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"1.4% (2016 est.) ++ 1.4% (2015 est.) ++ 1.3% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$44,900 (2016 est.) ++ $44,700 (2015 est.) ++ $44,100 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"51.8%","gdp_consumption":"24%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"23.3%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"-0.1%","gdp_exports":"83.1%","gdp_imports":"-82.1% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"0.6%","gdp_sector_industry":"21.8%","gdp_sector_services":"77.6% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"sugar beets, fresh vegetables, fruits, grain, tobacco;
