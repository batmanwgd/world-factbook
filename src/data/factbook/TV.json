The following year, the Ellice Islands became the separate British colony of Tuvalu. Independence was granted in 1978. In 2000, Tuvalu negotiated a contract leasing its Internet domain name \".tv\" for $50 million in royalties over a 12-year period. The agreement was subsequently renegotiated but details were not disclosed.","communications":{"country_id":"TV","fixed_phones_total":"2,000","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"18 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"4,000","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"37 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"serves particular needs for internal communications","phone_system_international":"country code - 688; international calls can be made by satellite (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"radiotelephone communications between islands","broadcast_media":"no TV stations; many households use satellite dishes to watch foreign TV stations; 1 government-owned radio station, Radio Tuvalu, includes relays of programming from international broadcasters (2009)","internet_country_code":"tv","internet_total_users":"5,000","internet_population_percent":"42.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:01","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:01"},"economy":{"country_id":"TV","overview":"Tuvalu consists of a densely populated, scattered group of nine coral atolls with poor soil. Only eight of the atolls are inhabited. It is one of the smallest countries in the world, with its highest point at 4.6 meters above sea level. The country is isolated, almost entirely dependent on imports, particularly of food and fuel, and vulnerable to climate change and rising sea levels, which pose significant challenges to development. ++  ++ The public sector dominates economic activity. Tuvalu has few natural resources, except for its fisheries. Earnings from fish exports and fishing licenses for Tuvaluâ€™s territorial waters are a significant source of government revenue. In 2013, revenue from fishing licenses doubled and totaled more than 45% of GDP. ++  ++ Official aid from foreign development partners has also increased. Tuvalu has substantial assets abroad. The Tuvalu Trust Fund, an international trust fund established in 1987 by development partners, has grown to $141 million in 2013 and is an important cushion for meeting shortfalls in the government's budget. While remittances are another substantial source of income, the value of remittances has declined since the 2008-2009 global financial crisis. Growing income inequality is one of many concerns for the nation.","gdp_power_parity":"$39 million (2016 est.) ++ $37.52 million (2015 est.) ++ $36.55 million (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"4% (2016 est.) ++ 2.6% (2015 est.) ++ 2.2% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$3,500 (2016 est.) ++ $3,400 (2015 est.) ++ $3,300 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"","gdp_consumption":"","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"","gdp_exports":"","gdp_imports":"","gdp_sector_agriculture":"24.5%","gdp_sector_industry":"5.6%","gdp_sector_services":"70% (2012 est.)","agriculture_products":"coconuts;
