{"id":"GI","iso_a3":"GIB","fips":"GI","continent":"EU","name":"Gibraltar","introduction":"Strategically important, Gibraltar was reluctantly ceded to Great Britain by Spain in the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht; the British garrison was formally declared a colony in 1830. In a referendum held in 1967, Gibraltarians voted overwhelmingly to remain a British dependency. The subsequent granting of autonomy in 1969 by the UK led Spain to close the border and sever all communication links. Between 1997 and 2002, the UK and Spain held a series of talks on establishing temporary joint sovereignty over Gibraltar. In response to these talks, the Gibraltar Government called a referendum in late 2002 in which the majority of citizens voted overwhelmingly against any sharing of sovereignty with Spain. Since late 2004, Spain, the UK, and Gibraltar have held tripartite talks with the aim of cooperatively resolving problems that affect the local population, and work continues on cooperation agreements in areas such as taxation and financial services; communications and maritime security; policy, legal and customs services; environmental protection; and education and visa services. Throughout 2009, a dispute over Gibraltar's claim to territorial waters extending out three miles gave rise to periodic non-violent maritime confrontations between Spanish and UK naval patrols and in 2013, the British reported a record number of entries by Spanish vessels into waters claimed by Gibraltar following a dispute over Gibraltar's creation of an artificial reef in those waters. A new noncolonial constitution came into effect in 2007, and the European Court of First Instance recognized Gibraltar's right to regulate its own tax regime in December 2008. The UK retains responsibility for defense, foreign relations, internal security, and financial stability.","communications":{"country_id":"GI","fixed_phones_total":"23,400","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"80 (July 2014 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"38,000","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"130 (July 2014 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"adequate, automatic domestic system and adequate international facilities","phone_system_international":"country code - 350; radiotelephone; microwave radio relay; satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean) (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"automatic exchange facilities","broadcast_media":"Gibraltar Broadcasting Corporation (GBC) provides TV and radio broadcasting services via 1 TV station and 4 radio stations; British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS) operates 1 radio station; broadcasts from Spanish radio and TV stations are accessible (2008)","internet_country_code":"gi","internet_total_users":"24,000","internet_population_percent":"82.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58"},"economy":{"country_id":"GI","overview":"Self-sufficient Gibraltar benefits from an extensive shipping trade, offshore banking, and its position as an international conference center. Tax rates are low to attract foreign investment. The British military presence has been sharply reduced and now contributes about 7% to the local economy, compared with 60% in 1984. In recent years, Gibraltar has seen major structural change from a public to a private sector economy, but changes in government spending still have a major impact on the level of employment. ++  ++ The financial sector, tourism (over 11 million visitors in 2012), gaming revenues, shipping services fees, and duties on consumer goods also generate revenue. The financial sector, tourism, and the shipping sector contribute 30%, 30%, and 25%, respectively, of GDP. Telecommunications, e-commerce, and e-gaming account for the remaining 15%.","gdp_power_parity":"$1.85 billion (2013 est.) ++ $2 billion (2012 est.) ++ $1.106 billion (2006 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"6% (2008 est.) ++ 8.8% (2007 est.) ++ 0% (2006 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$43,000 (2008 est.) ++ $41,200 (2007 est.) ++ $38,400 (2006 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"","gdp_consumption":"","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"","gdp_exports":"","gdp_imports":"","gdp_sector_agriculture":"0%","gdp_sector_industry":"0%","gdp_sector_services":"100% (2008 est.)","agriculture_products":"none","industries":"tourism, banking and finance, ship repairing, tobacco","industrial_growth_rate":"NA%","labor_force":"22,910 (2013 est.)","labor_force_notes":"","labor_force_services":"60% (2001)","labor_force_industry":"40%","labor_force_agriculture":"NEGL","labor_force_occupation_notes":"","unemployment_rate":"3% (2005 est.)","population_below_poverty":"NA%","household_income_lowest_10":"NA%","household_income_highest_10":"NA%","budget_revenues":"","taxes_revenues":"25.7% of GDP (2008 est.)","budget_net":"1.3% of GDP (2008 est.)","public_debt":"7.5% of GDP (2008 est.) ++ 9.3% of GDP (2006 est.)","external_debt":"$NA","fiscal_year":"1 July - 30 June","inflation_rate":"2.5% (2013 est.) ++ 2.2% (2012 est.)","central_bank_discount_rate":"","commercial_bank_prime_lending_rate":"","stock_money_narrow":"","stock_money_broad":"","stock_domestic_credit":"","exports":"$271 million (2004 est.)","exports_commodities":"(principally reexports) petroleum 51%, manufactured goods (2010 est.)","exports_partners":"","imports":"$2.967 billion (2004 est.)","imports_commodities":"fuels, manufactured goods, foodstuffs","imports_partners":"","exchange_rates":"Gibraltar pounds (GIP) per US dollar - ++ 0.9214 (2016 est.) ++ 0.885 (2015 est.) ++ 0.885 (2014 est.) ++ 0.7634 (2013 est.) ++ 0.64 (2012)","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:59","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:59"},"energy":{"country_id":"GI","electricity_production":"200 million kWh (2014 est.)","electricity_consumption":"200 million kWh (2014 est.)","electricity_exports":"0 kWh (2013 est.)","electricity_imports":"0 kWh (2013 est.)","electricity_generating_capacity":"43,000 kW (2014 est.)","electricity_fossil_fuels":"100% of total installed capacity (2012 est.)","electricity_nuclear":"0% of total installed capacity (2012 est.)","electricity_hydroelectric":"0% of total installed capacity (2012 est.)","electricity_renewable":"0% of total installed capacity (2012 est.)","crude_oil_production":"0 bbl\/day (2015 est.)","crude_oil_exports":"0 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","crude_oil_imports":"0 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","crude_oil_reserves":"0 bbl (1 January 2016 es)","petrol_production":"0 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","petrol_consumption":"80,000 bbl\/day (2014 est.)","petrol_exports":"0 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","petrol_imports":"76,680 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","natural_gas_production":"0 cu m (2013 est.)","natural_gas_consumption":"0 cu m (2013 est.)","natural_gas_exports":"0 cu m (2013 est.)","natural_gas_imports":"0 cu m (2013 est.)","natural_gas_reserves":"0 cu m (1 January 2014 es)","co2_output":"3.6 million Mt (2013 est.)","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58"},"geography":{"country_id":"GI","location_description":"Southwestern Europe, bordering the Strait of Gibraltar, which links the Mediterranean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean, on the southern coast of Spain","latitude":"36.1377410","longitude":"-5.3453740","mapReferences":"Europe","area_sqkm_total":6,"area_sqkm_land":6,"area_sqkm_water":0,"area_km_coastline":12,"area_note":"more than 10 times the size of The National Mall in Washington, D.C.","climate":"Mediterranean with mild winters and warm summers","terrain":"a narrow coastal lowland borders the Rock of Gibraltar","hazards":"NA","notes":"strategic location on Strait of Gibraltar that links the North Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:58"},"government":{"country_id":"GI","name":"none","name_etymology":"from the Spanish derivation of the Arabic \"Jabal Tariq,\" which means \"Mountain of Tariq\" and which refers to the Rock of Gibraltar","conventional_long_form":"none","conventional_short_form":"Gibraltar","dependency_status":"overseas territory of the UK","government_type":"parliamentary democracy (Parliament);
