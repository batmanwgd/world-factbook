When the latter dissolved in 1830, Panama remained part of Colombia. With US backing, Panama seceded from Colombia in 1903 and promptly signed a treaty with the US allowing for the construction of a canal and US sovereignty over a strip of land on either side of the structure (the Panama Canal Zone). The Panama Canal was built by the US Army Corps of Engineers between 1904 and 1914. In 1977, an agreement was signed for the complete transfer of the Canal from the US to Panama by the end of the century. Certain portions of the Zone and increasing responsibility over the Canal were turned over in the subsequent decades. With US help, dictator Manuel NORIEGA was deposed in 1989. The entire Panama Canal, the area supporting the Canal, and remaining US military bases were transferred to Panama by the end of 1999. An ambitious expansion project to more than double the Canal's capacity - by allowing for more Canal transits and larger ships - was carried out between 2007 and 2016.","communications":{"country_id":"PA","fixed_phones_total":"384,135","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"6 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"7.412 million","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"109 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"the fixed-line market is a state monopoly and fixed-line telephone service is meager; principal switching center is in Asuncion","phone_system_international":"country code - 595; satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean) (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"deficiencies in provision of fixed-line service have resulted in a rapid expansion of mobile-cellular services fostered by competition among multiple providers","broadcast_media":"6 privately owned TV stations; about 75 commercial and community radio stations; 1 state-owned radio network (2010)","internet_country_code":"py","internet_total_users":"3.011 million","internet_population_percent":"44.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:00","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:00"},"economy":{"country_id":"PA","overview":"Landlocked Paraguay has a market economy distinguished by a large informal sector, featuring re-export of imported consumer goods to neighboring countries, as well as the activities of thousands of microenterprises and urban street vendors. A large percentage of the population, especially in rural areas, derives its living from agricultural activity, often on a subsistence basis. Because of the importance of the informal sector, accurate economic measures are difficult to obtain. ++  ++ On a per capita basis, real income has stagnated at 1980 levels. The economy grew rapidly between 2003 and 2008 as growing world demand for commodities combined with high prices and favorable weather to support Paraguay's commodity-based export expansion. Paraguay is the sixth largest soy producer in the world. Drought hit in 2008, reducing agricultural exports and slowing the economy even before the onset of the global recession. The economy fell 3.8% in 2009, as lower world demand and commodity prices caused exports to contract. The government reacted by introducing fiscal and monetary stimulus packages. Growth resumed in 2010, and has been erratic, although positive, ever since. Severe drought and outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease led to a drop in beef and other agricultural exports. ++  ++ In addition to the agricultural challenges, political uncertainty, corruption, limited progress on structural reform, and deficient infrastructure are the main obstacles to long-term growth.","gdp_power_parity":"$64.12 billion (2016 est.) ++ $61.94 billion (2015 est.) ++ $60.09 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"3.5% (2016 est.) ++ 3.1% (2015 est.) ++ 4.7% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$9,400 (2016 est.) ++ $9,200 (2015 est.) ++ $9,000 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"67.4%","gdp_consumption":"12.9%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"15.3%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"0.3%","gdp_exports":"43.3%","gdp_imports":"-39.2% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"17.1%","gdp_sector_industry":"27.3%","gdp_sector_services":"55.6% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"cotton, sugarcane, soybeans, corn, wheat, tobacco, cassava (manioc, tapioca), fruits, vegetables;
