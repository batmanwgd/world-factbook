{"id":"NR","iso_a3":"NRU","fips":"NR","continent":"OC","name":"Nauru","introduction":"The exact origins of the Nauruans are unclear since their language does not resemble any other in the Pacific region. Germany annexed the island in 1888. A German-British consortium began mining the island's phosphate deposits early in the 20th century. Australian forces occupied Nauru in World War I; it subsequently became a League of Nations mandate. After the Second World War - and a brutal occupation by Japan - Nauru became a UN trust territory. It achieved independence in 1968 and joined the UN in 1999 as the world's smallest independent republic.","communications":{"country_id":"NR","fixed_phones_total":"1,900","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"14 (July 2009 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"6,800","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"73 (July 2012 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"adequate local and international radiotelephone communication provided via Australian facilities","phone_system_international":"country code - 674; satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat (Pacific Ocean)","phone_system_domestic":"","broadcast_media":"1 government-owned TV station broadcasting programs from New Zealand sent via satellite or on videotape; 1 government-owned radio station, broadcasting on AM and FM, utilizes Australian and British programs (2009)","internet_country_code":"nr","internet_total_users":"5,100","internet_population_percent":"53.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:00","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:00"},"economy":{"country_id":"NR","overview":"Revenues of this tiny island - a coral atoll with a land area of 21 square kilometers - traditionally have come from exports of phosphates. Few other resources exist, with most necessities being imported, mainly from Australia, its former occupier and later major source of support. Primary reserves of phosphates were exhausted and mining ceased in 2006, but mining of a deeper layer of \"secondary phosphate\" in the interior of the island began the following year. The secondary phosphate deposits may last another 30 years. Earnings from Nauruâ€™s export of phosphate remains an important source of income. Few comprehensive statistics on the Nauru economy exist; estimates of Nauru's GDP vary widely. ++  ++ The rehabilitation of mined land and the replacement of income from phosphates are serious long-term problems. In anticipation of the exhaustion of Nauru's phosphate deposits, substantial amounts of phosphate income were invested in trust funds to help cushion the transition and provide for Nauru's economic future. ++  ++ Although revenue sources for government are limited, the opening of the Australian Regional Processing Center for asylum seekers since 2012 has sparked growth in the economy. Revenue derived from fishing licenses under the \"vessel day scheme\" has also boosted government income. Housing, hospitals, and other capital plant are deteriorating. The cost to Australia of keeping the government and economy afloat continues to climb.","gdp_power_parity":"$150.8 million (2015 est.) ++ $139.7 million (2014 est.) ++ $127 million (2013 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"8% (2015 est.) ++ 10% (2014 est.) ++ 4.5% (2013 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$14,800 (2015 est.) ++ $13,700 (2014 est.) ++ $12,500 (2013 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"","gdp_consumption":"","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"","gdp_exports":"","gdp_imports":"","gdp_sector_agriculture":"6.1%","gdp_sector_industry":"33%","gdp_sector_services":"60.8% (2009 est.)","agriculture_products":"coconuts","industries":"phosphate mining, offshore banking, coconut products","industrial_growth_rate":"NA%","labor_force":"NA","labor_force_notes":"","labor_force_services":"","labor_force_industry":"","labor_force_agriculture":"","labor_force_occupation_notes":"most of the labor force is employed in phosphate mining, public administration, education, and transportation","unemployment_rate":"23% (2011 est.) ++ 90% (2004 est.)","population_below_poverty":"NA%","household_income_lowest_10":"NA%","household_income_highest_10":"NA%","budget_revenues":"","taxes_revenues":"","budget_net":"","public_debt":"","external_debt":"$33.3 million (2004 est.)","fiscal_year":"1 July - 30 June","inflation_rate":"8% (2015 est.) ++ 5% (2015 est.)","central_bank_discount_rate":"","commercial_bank_prime_lending_rate":"","stock_money_narrow":"","stock_money_broad":"","stock_domestic_credit":"","exports":"$125 million (2013 est.) ++ $110.3 million (2012 est.)","exports_commodities":"phosphates","exports_partners":"","imports":"$143.1 million (2013 est.) ++ $41.2 million (2012 est.)","imports_commodities":"food, fuel, manufactures, building materials, machinery","imports_partners":"","exchange_rates":"Australian dollars (AUD) per US dollar - ++ 1.352 (2016 est.) ++ 1.3291 (2015 est.) ++ 1.3291 (2014 est.) ++ 1.0358 (2013 est.) ++ 0.97 (2012 est.)","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:00","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:00"},"energy":{"country_id":"NR","electricity_production":"25 million kWh (2014 est.)","electricity_consumption":"23.25 million kWh (2014 est.)","electricity_exports":"0 kWh (2013 est.)","electricity_imports":"0 kWh (2013 est.)","electricity_generating_capacity":"5,000 kW (2014 est.)","electricity_fossil_fuels":"100% of total installed capacity (2012 est.)","electricity_nuclear":"0% of total installed capacity (2012 est.)","electricity_hydroelectric":"0% of total installed capacity (2012 est.)","electricity_renewable":"0% of total installed capacity (2012 est.)","crude_oil_production":"0 bbl\/day (2015 est.)","crude_oil_exports":"0 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","crude_oil_imports":"0 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","crude_oil_reserves":"0 bbl (1 January 2016 es)","petrol_production":"0 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","petrol_consumption":"400 bbl\/day (2014 est.)","petrol_exports":"0 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","petrol_imports":"394.8 bbl\/day (2013 est.)","natural_gas_production":"0 cu m (2013 est.)","natural_gas_consumption":"0 cu m (2013 est.)","natural_gas_exports":"0 cu m (2013 est.)","natural_gas_imports":"0 cu m (2013 est.)","natural_gas_reserves":"0 cu m (1 January 2014 es)","co2_output":"200,000 Mt (2013 est.)","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:00","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:00"},"geography":{"country_id":"NR","location_description":"Oceania, island in the South Pacific Ocean, south of the Marshall Islands","latitude":"-0.5227780","longitude":"166.9315030","mapReferences":"Oceania","area_sqkm_total":21,"area_sqkm_land":21,"area_sqkm_water":0,"area_km_coastline":30,"area_note":"about 0.1 times the size of Washington, DC","climate":"tropical with a monsoonal pattern;
