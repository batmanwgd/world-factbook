{"id":"JO","iso_a3":"JOR","fips":"JO","continent":"AS","name":"Jordan","introduction":"Following World War I and the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, the League of Nations awarded Britain the mandate to govern much of the Middle East. Britain demarcated a semi-autonomous region of Transjordan from Palestine in the early 1920s. The area gained its independence in 1946 and thereafter became The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. The country's long-time ruler, King HUSSEIN (1953-99), successfully navigated competing pressures from the major powers (US, USSR, and UK), various Arab states, Israel, and a large internal Palestinian population. Jordan lost the West Bank to Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War. King HUSSEIN in 1988 permanently relinquished Jordanian claims to the West Bank; in 1994 he signed a peace treaty with Israel. King ABDALLAH II, King HUSSEIN's eldest son, assumed the throne following his father's death in 1999. He has implemented modest political and economic reforms, including the passage of a new electoral law in early 2016 ahead of legislative elections held in September. The Islamic Action Front, which is the political arm of the Jordanian Muslim Brotherhood, returned to parliament with 15 seats after boycotting the previous two elections in 2010 and 2013.","communications":{"country_id":"JO","fixed_phones_total":"368,938","fixed_phones_subs_per_100":"5 (July 2015 est.)","mobile_phones_total":"13.798 million","mobile_phones_subs_per_100":"170 (July 2015 est.)","phone_system_general_assessment":"service has improved recently with increased use of digital switching equipment; microwave radio relay transmission and coaxial and fiber-optic cable are employed on trunk lines; growing mobile-cellular usage in both urban and rural areas is reducing use","phone_system_international":"country code - 962; landing point for the Fiber-Optic Link Around the Globe (FLAG) FEA and FLAG Falcon submarine cable networks; satellite earth stations - 33 (3 Intelsat, 1 Arabsat, and 29 land and maritime Inmarsat terminals); fiber-optic cable to Saudi (2015)","phone_system_domestic":"1995 telecommunications law opened all non-fixed-line services to private competition; in 2005, monopoly over fixed-line services terminated and the entire telecommunications sector was opened to competition; currently multiple mobile-cellular providers w","broadcast_media":"radio and TV dominated by the government-owned Jordan Radio and Television Corporation (JRTV) that operates a main network, a sports network, a film network, and a satellite channel; first independent TV broadcaster aired in 2007; international satellite (2007)","internet_country_code":"jo","internet_total_users":"4.335 million","internet_population_percent":"53.0","created_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:59","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:35:59"},"economy":{"country_id":"JO","overview":"Jordan's economy is among the smallest in the Middle East, with insufficient supplies of water, oil, and other natural resources, underlying the government's heavy reliance on foreign assistance. Other economic challenges for the government include chronic high rates of poverty, unemployment and underemployment, budget and current account deficits, and government debt. ++  ++ King ABDALLAH, during the first decade of the 2000s, implemented significant economic reforms, such as expanding foreign trade and privatizing state-owned companies that attracted foreign investment and contributed to average annual economic growth of 8% for 2004 through 2008. The global economic slowdown and regional turmoil contributed to slower growth from 2010 to 2014 - with growth averaging 2.8% per year - and hurt export-oriented sectors, construction, and tourism. Through 2014, Jordan's finances were strained by a series of natural gas pipeline attacks in Egypt, disrupting natural gas exports to Jordan, and led Jordan to rely on more expensive diesel imports, primarily from Saudi Arabia, to generate electricity. ++  ++ To diversify its energy mix, Jordan has secured several contracts for liquefied natural gas and is currently exploring nuclear power generation, exploitation of abundant oil shale reserves and renewable technologies, as well as the import of Israeli offshore gas. In August 2015, Jordan completed a $2.1 billion, three-year IMF Stand-By Arrangement, which the government had entered to help correct budgetary and balance of payments imbalances. Jordan plans to expand on its fiscal reform measures enacted over the previous few years with a follow-on IMF agreement in 2016 to boost government revenues, reduce the budget deficit, and manage its burgeoning debt, brought on in part by an influx of over 650,000 Syrian refugees since 2011, which put additional pressure on expenditures.","gdp_power_parity":"$86.19 billion (2016 est.) ++ $83.89 billion (2015 est.) ++ $81.93 billion (2014 est.)","gdp_real_growth":"2.8% (2016 est.) ++ 2.4% (2015 est.) ++ 3.1% (2014 est.)","gdp_per_capita":"$11,100 (2016 est.) ++ $11,000 (2015 est.) ++ $11,000 (2014 est.)","gdp_household_consumption":"81.1%","gdp_consumption":"19.8%","gdp_investment_in_fixed_capital":"22.6%","gdp_investment_in_inventories":"3.1%","gdp_exports":"32.7%","gdp_imports":"-59.3% (2016 est.)","gdp_sector_agriculture":"4.2%","gdp_sector_industry":"29.6%","gdp_sector_services":"66.2% (2016 est.)","agriculture_products":"citrus, tomatoes, cucumbers, olives, strawberries, stone fruits;
